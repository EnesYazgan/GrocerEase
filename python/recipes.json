    "steps": [
        "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0. Trim the ends off of 1 onion. Cut in half through root end, peel and discard skin, then coarsely chop. (No need to sweat the knife work here\u2014it's all going to get blended anyway.) Transfer chopped onion to a medium bowl.",
        "Using the flat side of chef\u2019s knife, smash 3 garlic cloves. Peel and discard skins, then coarsely chop. Transfer to the bowl with the chopped onion.",
        "Using a spoon, peel 2\" piece ginger. (We always like to use a spoon to peel ginger, which is way better for navigating all of those nooks and crannies than a vegetable peeler.) Thinly slice and add to bowl with onion and garlic.",
        "Trim a handful of cilantro leaves with tender stems; set aside for serving. Coarsely chop remaining stems and transfer about 1/4 cup chopped stems to bowl with onion. Clear your cutting board.",
        "It\u2019s time to break down your squash! (We promise it\u2019s not as scary as it sounds.) Trim off both ends of 1 butternut squash, then cut through where the neck meets the bulb. (This makes it easier to peel.) Peel both pieces of squash with a vegetable peeler. Cut squash neck and bulb in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop out seeds from each half of the bulb; discard seeds. Place squash pieces cut side down on board and cut each piece in half lengthwise. Cut squash crosswise into 1\"-thick slices. Again, you don't need to worry about beautiful knife work here, but it's good for the pieces to be similarly sized so they cook at the same rate.",
        "Vigorously shake 13.5-oz. can of coconut milk for a few seconds so everything gets well mixed. Open can and set aside 3 Tbsp. milk to swirl over finished soup.",
        "Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or saucepan over medium. Add onion mixture, 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp. salt and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until onion is translucent and soft, 5-7 minutes.",
        "Add squash and give everything a stir to coat. Add 3 cups water, or enough to just submerge the squash, remaining coconut milk in can, and 2 tsp. salt, then stir to combine. Raise heat to high and bring soup to a boil.",
        "Once soup is boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very tender, 12-14 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, prepare your garnishes. Spread 1/2 cup coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast in oven until golden brown, about 5 minutes. (If you can't find big coconut flakes, shredded is okay, too, but it will probably take less time to toast. Just make sure to avoid any pre-sweetened stuff.) Keep an eye on them\u2014coconut flakes can go from golden to burnt in seconds. Cut 1 lime into wedges; set aside for serving. Using a fork or citrus reamer, juice the second lime into a small bowl.",
        "You\u2019re almost ready to blend\u2014so let\u2019s do this! First things first: set up your workstation. You\u2019ll need your pot of soup, blender, a large bowl, a ladle, and a clean kitchen towel all within arm\u2019s reach. Using ladle, fill blender pitcher no more than halfway with equal parts broth and vegetables (if you fill it up, it will overflow as it blends!). Now, here\u2019s the most important step of this entire recipe: When you secure the blender lid, make sure there is a vent for the steam to escape (many blender lids come with removable vents). If you skip this step, the lid will blow off and you will end up with soup on every inch of your kitchen.",
        "Holding the lid down with a folded kitchen towel, carefully blend soup, starting from the lowest speed and working your way up to high, until smooth and silky, 10-15 seconds. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat, working in batches, until all soup is blended.",
        "Wipe out Dutch oven and return to stove. Pour soup back into pot and heat over medium, stirring occasionally, until you can see steam rising from the pot. (You may be tempted to serve the soup straight from the blender, but it loses a lot of heat in the blending process and gets lukewarm. Trust us\u2014you want to reheat it.) Stir in lime juice. Taste and add more salt if needed.",
        "Ladle soup into bowls. Top with a swirl of reserved coconut milk, toasted coconut flakes, and cilantro. Serve with reserved lime wedges.",
        "Do Ahead: Soup and toppings can be made 4 days ahead. Store in separate airtight containers and chill."

        "Melt 1/2 stick butter in a small saucepan or microwave in a small bowl.",
        "Place 1 3-4-lb. whole chicken on a cutting board (best to use a plastic one you can sterilize). A word on bird size. A 3-4-lb. chicken is pretty much the ideal size for roasting this way. Something a little bit bigger will work, but once you get much past 41/2-lbs. it becomes harder to guarantee that the breast meat won't dry out in the time it takes the dark meat to cook. Pat the whole thing dry with paper towels. It's super important to get the chicken as dry as possible, which helps with browning.",
        "With chicken breast facing up and legs pointing toward you, use a sharp knife to slice through loose area of skin connecting the leg and breast, making about a 3\"-long incision. Continue cutting downward until you hit the joint that connects the thigh to the body, then stop (once you get through the skin, there\u2019s not much there; if you are cutting through flesh, you\u2019re too close to the breast). This exposes the leg joint, making it easy to tell if chicken is cooked. Repeat on second side.",
        "Season every surface of chicken, including skin along backbone, inside cavity, under wings, and inside part of the leg you just exposed, with lots of salt and pepper. If you\u2019re using kosher salt, it should take you 4-5 generous\u2014as in, four finger\u2014pinches, which will be around 4 whole teaspoons.",
        "Transfer chicken breast side up to a large oven-safe skillet. Arrange lemon and garlic cut sides down in skillet around chicken.",
        "Drizzle chicken all over with melted butter (mmmmmmm) and transfer to oven.",
        "Roast until chicken is nicely browned and cooked through, checking for doneness after 45 minutes. To check, carefully remove skillet from oven (the handle is hot!), poke a knife into leg joints, and pierce the meat. If juices run clear, the chicken is done. If you see a rosy pink color, it needs more time. Continue to roast, checking every 5 minutes, until juices run clear. (If you\u2019re not sure, you can also use the knife to lightly shred some of the meat along the thigh bone\u2014the meat should look opaque and the fibers should separate easily.)",
        "Let chicken rest in skillet at least 15 minutes before carving\u2014this will help the juices in the meat to settle, and will also get it down to a temperature that is cool enough to handle with your bare hands while carving. Don't worry: It's a big piece of meat, so it will still be plenty warm by the time you serve it. Transfer chicken to a platter. Pour all of those glorious, buttery pan juices over top of the meat and serve with roasted lemon and garlic alongside. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!",
        "Do Ahead: Chicken can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool. Cover and chill; bring to room temperature before serving."

        "Heat a small skillet over medium. Toast 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds, tossing frequently, until seeds are a light golden color and slightly fragrant, about 2 minutes. Seeds you toast yourself are always going to be more flavorful than the ones you buy already toasted, but we won't judge if you don't feel like going the extra mile.",

Place pieces skin side down in a cold\u2014as in not preheated; you don't have to refrigerate it or anything\u2014cast-iron skillet. (This might seem a little weird, but trust us\u2014the skin will render nicely and get way more crispy this way.) Heat skillet over medium and let the salmon cook undisturbed for 5 minutes.",
        "Press down lightly on flesh with a spatula to ensure all parts of the skin are making contact with the pan. At this point it should be opaque at least halfway up the flesh side. Continue to cook skin side down until fish is opaque all the way through and skin is crispy, about 5 minutes longer. If the skin is still sticking to the pan at this point, don't try to un-stick it\u2014you'll know that it's ready to flip when it releases on its own.",
        "Using a fish spatula, gently flip the fillets, then remove the pan from the heat. Continue to cook off-heat (the pan will still be plenty hot) until flesh is juuuuuuuust cooked through, about 1 minute longer for regular-sized fillets, but very thick ones might take up to 3 minutes more\u2014you can use a fork to flake the fish slightly to check for doneness; you're looking for the inside to be still a little pink and translucent.",
        "Spoon miso-honey sauce onto a platter. Place salmon fillets skin side up on top of the sauce. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and scallions. Et voila! Dinner is served."

Halve the lemon you just zested and squeeze juice into bowl, using your hand to catch any seeds. (You can use a citrus squeezer for this if you've got one.) Add remaining 1/2 cup oil and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and add more seasoning if necessary\u2014it should be good and punchy.",

        "Start by doing a little prep work. Peel and chop 1 onion and 1 carrot.",
        "Peel 3 garlic cloves by smashing each firmly with the flat side of a knife to break into smaller pieces. Discard skins. The cool thing about prepping garlic for any kind of long-cooking preparation like this is that it will have plenty of time to break down and infuse the whole soup with garlicky goodness, which means there's no need to go through the tedious process of mincing the cloves finely.",
        "Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large stock pot or Dutch oven over medium. Add onion, carrot, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is golden, 5-7 minutes. Don't worry if the veggies start sticking to the bottom of the pan a little bit\u2014that's a good thing! Those little browned bits have a ton of flavor, and we'll be adding some liquid in the next step to get them up, a process that's also called \"deglazing.\" Cool, huh?",
        "Add 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and cook, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pot, until vinegar is reduced by about half.",
        "Add 2 Tbsp. adobo sauce from can of chiles and stir to coat. (Feel free to add more adobo sauce if you're craving more heat and smokiness; just remember: You can always add more later, but you can't take any away.)",
        "Add 1 lb. dried black beans, 11/2 tsp. oregano, 1 Tbsp. salt, and 8 cups water. That's right: no boxed stock! The beans are going to create their own delicious broth as they simmer away. Bring up to a boil over high heat, then drop the heat down low so that the beans are just simmering. Cover pot with a lid.",
        "Simmer, stirring every 30 minutes to prevent sticking, until beans are tender and creamy, 11/2-2 hours. How long it takes will depend entirely on how fresh your beans are\u2014the longer they've been sitting on the shelf, the longer they're going to take to cook. That's why we try to buy dried beans from stores where we know their inventory moves. (You can't always tell, but dust on the bag is never a good sign.) As the beans cook, you may need to top off with a bit more hot water if too much of it cooks off; you want to make sure the beans are submerged.",
        "Meanwhile, assemble your garnishes. They're going to be the difference between an extremely simple\u2014and delicious!\u2014pot of black bean soup and something that feels fun and kind of fancy. The first thing we're going to make is a kind of creamy lime-yogurt to dollop on top. First, place 1 cup yogurt in a small bowl. Finely grate zest from 1 lime into bowl. Cut the lime in half and squeeze in juice.",
        "Season yogurt mixture with salt. Give it a taste and add another pinch of salt if it doesn't pop. Easy, and kind of fancy, non? Cut remaining 2 limes into wedges for squeezing over the soup.",
        "Prepare any other (optional) garnishes you may like. Slice some ripe avocado. Put some Fritos or tortilla chips or corn nuts in a bowl. Pick some cilantro leaves. Chop some onion, or thinly slice some scallions. Shred some cabbage. If you ask us, the more garnishes, the better!",
        "Taste and season soup with salt, if needed. Remember: Beans can handle quite a bit of salt, so don't be afraid to add more if it tastes kind of \"meh.\" You can serve right away, but we usually like to let a bean soup like this hang out for at least a half hour after we've finished seasoning it so that the salt in the cooking liquid can work its way into the beans themselves. Ladle the soup into bowls, top with yogurt mixture, and serve with lime wedges and any other garnishes your heart desires.",
        "Do Ahead: Soup, without garnishes, can be made 1 week ahead; store in an airtight container and chill, or freeze up to 3 months."

        "Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Butter a 9x4\" loaf pan, fully coating bottom and sides. Line pan lengthwise with parchment paper, leaving about a 2\" overhang. Are you reading this and wondering, \"Can I use wax paper instead of parchment paper?\" The answer is: absolutely NOT. That strip of parchment paper will help you to lift the finished cake out of the loaf pan cleanly. Wax paper, on the other hand, will melt and stick to the cake\u2014it's never meant to go into the oven. Now you know!",
        "Using a Microplane, finely grate the zest from 2 lemons into a large bowl. Add 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted room temperature butter and 1 cup granulated sugar to bowl. It might be tempting to ignore the part about the butter being \"room temperature,\" but working with butter that's soft and spreadable\u2014but not melted\u2014is essential here.",
        "Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat until mixture is very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. You know how people talk about \"creaming\" butter and sugar together? That's what you're doing here. You're basically whipping a bunch of air into the butter and sugar mixture, which will help keep the finished cake light and fluffy. And as we mentioned in the last step, that butter needs to be room temp in order for this to work.",
        "Beat in 3 eggs one at a time, waiting until each is incorporated before adding the next. Continue to beat until mixture is lighter and even fluffier, about 2 minutes.",
        "Whisk 13/4 cups all-purpose flour, 11/2 tsp. baking powder, and 1/2 tsp. salt in another large bowl. It might seem funny to add salt to a dessert recipe, but a little bit helps to make all of the rich, sweet elements really sing.",
        "Add one-half of dry ingredients to butter mixture and beat on low speed just until combined.",
        "Beat in 6 Tbsp. milk on low just until smooth, then add remaining dry ingredients and beat just until combined. Now that you've added the flour, you want to mix the batter as little as possible\u2014if you beat it up too much, you'll start to form gluten, which will make the cake tough. Using a spatula, scrape down sides of bowl and give batter a final mix so dry ingredients are fully incorporated.",
        "Scrape batter into your buttered loaf pan; smooth top with a spatula. Bake cake, turning once halfway through, until a cake tester, toothpick, skewer, or thin knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 45-55 minutes.",
        "While the cake bakes, make the glaze: First, remove zest from remaining lemon with a vegetable peeler in wide strips. (FWIW, if this part seems overly fussy or annoying, you can feel free to just use a Microplane to zest all of the lemons for the glaze, but we think doing it this way looks cuter.)",
        "Transfer zest to a cutting board and slice as thinly as possible; set aside.",
        "Halve 2 lemons (the ones you already zested) and squeeze the juice into a small bowl with a reamer or fork (you should have about 1/2 cup lemon juice).",
        "Place 11/2 cups powdered sugar in another medium bowl. Slowly whisk in about half of lemon juice until smooth, then add sliced lemon zest; set glaze aside.",
        "Let cake cool about 10 minutes. (Yeah, it really does need to cool a bit, so set a timer if you're impatient.) Poke 10-15 holes evenly throughout cake with a cake tester or toothpick. Pour the remaining lemon juice\u2014the stuff that didn't end up going into the glaze\u2014over the top of the cake. Let cool completely. (Seriously!)",
        "Run a butter knife around edges of pan to loosen. Using parchment overhang, lift cake onto a wire rack; remove parchment.",
        "Now, pour the lemon zest glaze over cake, letting it fall down the sides. Let icing set for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Serve on its own, or with a spoonful of Greek yogurt, a dollop of whipped cream, or a scoop of ice cream on top. (You deserve it!)"

    "steps": [
        "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0. Pat 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Moisture is the enemy of well-browned meat, so it's super important to get them as dry as possible before searing them. Season generously on all sides with 1 Tbsp. salt.",
        "Okay, this is going to seem a little bit out there, but trust us: It works. Place a cold, dry large Dutch oven on the stove\u2014no heat yet! Nestle all of your chicken thighs in there, skin side down, so that there is as much skin-to-pan contact as possible (it's fine if they're crowded together). Then turn the heat under the pan to medium. As the pan becomes hotter and hotter, the skin will start to release some of its fat and then get extra crispy and brown, a process that will probably take around 15-20 minutes. (Try not to fuss with the thighs too much while this is happening, just let them be. This is a good time to do some of the prep work outlined in the next few steps.) When the skin is deeply browned\u2014we're only cooking the skin side right now\u2014use tongs to transfer the thighs skin side up to a plate. Turn off the heat under the Dutch oven, but reserve it\u2014we're going to build our braise in it, and we want all of that fat and any browned, stuck-on bits, which will lend richness and flavor to the finished dish.",
        "While chicken is browning, do some prep: First, peel 2 onions and cut them in half through the root end. Slice 3 of the onion halves into 3 wedges each, and set the remaining half aside for later.",
        "Smash 3 garlic cloves with the flat side of a knife and remove the peel.",
        "Using a spoon, peel 2\" piece ginger. (Peeling knobby ginger with a vegetable peeler is a pain, but a spoon can get into all of those little nooks and crannies much more easily. Use a Microplane to finely grate the ginger into a small bowl.",
        "Cook onion wedges in the reserved pot\u2014the same one you seared the chicken in\u2014over medium heat, stirring often, until golden brown in spots and translucent, 4-6 minutes.",
        "Now you're going to start building the base for your braise. First, add your garlic and ginger and cook just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 2 Tbsp. curry powder, stirring to coat until fragrant, a minute or two more. Deglaze the pan by adding a splash of water, vigorously stirring to loosen and dissolve brown bits on bottom of the pot. Add half of coconut milk (shake it well before you open the can, as it can separate!), followed by 1 cup water. Bring the liquid up to a simmer.",
        "Chicken time! Arrange the thighs, skin side up, in the Dutch oven so that the meat is partially submerged in the braising liquid. Cover and transfer to the oven to bake for 30 minutes.",
        "While the chicken does its thing, you're going to make a zippy coconut condiment for spooning over the finished dish. (Who doesn't love a good topping?) Start by spreading 1/2 cup coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet and placing it in the oven along with the chicken. Bake coconut until golden brown, about 5 minutes\u2014it'll go fast, so set a timer and keep an eye on it.",
        "Now, finely chop the reserved half onion from earlier and transfer to a small bowl.",
        "Finely grate zest of 1 lime into bowl of chopped onions. There's a ton of flavor in citrus peel, so it's always good to try to find a way to use it if you can. Cut the now-zested lime into wedges and squeeze the juice over onion mixture. Cut remaining lime into 4 wedges and save those for serving later.",
        "Cut off the bottom inch of stem from a small handful of cilantro, then finely chop up the stems until you get to the leaves; reserve leaves for serving. Add stems and toasted coconut to bowl with onion mixture (don\u2019t toss the mixture just yet, otherwise the coconut will get soggy).",
        "Peel 3 sweet potatoes and cut into 2\" pieces.",
        "After 30 minutes, uncover Dutch oven and add potatoes and remaining coconut milk. Use tongs to move things around so that the the vegetables are submerged underneath the chicken thighs, which you want to have arranged skin side up. Return the pot to the oven\u2014uncovered this time\u2014and cook until the sweet potatoes are soft enough that they can be pierced with a knife and the chicken is tender, another 15-30 minutes. (This is a good time to start your rice. If you don't have a rice cooker, this is our go-to stovetop rice cooking method.). After this amount of time, the chicken should be tender, juicy, and nicely cooked, but you can let it go for another 30-45 minutes if you're after a more shreddable, falling-apart tender result.",
        "Meanwhile, toss coconut condiment with 1/2 tsp.salt.",
        "And there you have it! Serve chicken thighs, curry sauce, and veggies over rice. Top with coconut condiment and reserved cilantro leaves, and serve with lime wedges alongside for squeezing.",
        "Do Ahead: Braised chicken can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Reheat over low heat before serving."

        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. (Higher heat = more caramelization, more quickly.) Remove bottom 2\" of tough stem from 1 head of broccoli with a chef\u2019s knife; discard. Cut broccoli crosswise, starting with the stem end (yep, you can eat most of the stem!) into 1/4\" slices. When you reach the crown, slow your slicing so you can push the florets to the side as they begin to fall with each slice. You want to have lots of loose florets. No matter what kinds of veggies you're roasting, you want to cut them into pieces that are about the same size so that they cook at the same(ish) rate.",
        "Transfer broccoli to a rimmed baking sheet. (If you don't have a proper, heavy-duty aluminum half sheet pan, this is a reminder to invest in one ASAP.) Drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil; season with 1 tsp. salt and toss to coat. If you were interested in adding any spices\u2014think curry powder, chile flakes, fennel seeds\u2014this is the time to do it.",
        "Arrange broccoli on pan in a single layer, spacing so no pieces overlap (this ensures broccoli will roast properly, not just steam). Roast until nicely browned, even charred in spots, and crispy with a bright green interior, 8-10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, make your tahini sauce. Cut 1 lemon in half. Using a citrus juicer (or your hands), juice lemon (fish out any seeds) into a small bowl. Cut remaining 1 lemon into wedges; set aside for serving. Peel 1 garlic clove and use a Microplane to grate it into bowl with lemon juice. (We're big fans of grated garlic over here, especially when it comes to dressings and sauces. It's a hell of a lot easier than trying to get a fine, even mince with a knife, and there's no risk of biting into a big chunk of raw garlic later on.)",
        "Add 5 Tbsp. tahini, 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/4 cup hot water and whisk until smooth. Give it a taste: The richness of the tahini and zippiness from the lemon should be nicely balanced, so adjust with more of either if necessary, and don't be afraid to add more salt if the sauce doesn't pop.",
        "Gently toss broccoli by giving pan a shake (or use a spatula). Continue to roast until browned in spots and tender, 5-8 minutes longer. As with all recipes, the amount of time it takes is going to have a lot to do with the equipment you're using\u2014you want that broccoli to have plenty of color on it, so don't be afraid to keep roasting until you get there.",
        "Heat a small skillet over medium. Toast 2 Tbsp. sesame seeds, tossing frequently, until light golden and slightly fragrant, about 2 minutes. Don\u2019t walk away; the seeds will burn quickly! Let cool. (And, FWIW, this recipe will still be good if you skipped the sesame seeds\u2014but if you're going to use them, make sure to toast them, which will make them a lot more flavorful. Cool?)",
        "Transfer broccoli to a platter and drizzle with tahini sauce. Top with sesame seeds and reserved lemon wedges for squeezing over. One of the great things about roasted vegetables is that they're just as delicious room temperature as they are piping hot, so don't stress if the rest of dinner isn't ready yet."

        "Pat steak dry with paper towels and place on a clean plate. Season very generously all over with salt and pepper. (Think four-fingered pinches of salt\u2014rich proteins like steak need a lot more salt than you might think.) Let it sit at room temperature while you prep your other salad components, at least an hour if possible. (Don't worry: It's safe, and a room-temperature steak will cook more evenly than it will straight out of the fridge.)",
        "Salad dressing time! Peel and finely chop 1 shallot and transfer to a medium bowl. Add 1 Tbsp. mustard and 1 Tbsp. vinegar and whisk to combine. Here comes the fun part: Whisking constantly, slowly stream in 5 Tbsp. olive oil until dressing is thick and emulsified. The word \"slowly\" is key here\u2014if you add the oil all at once, you won't get the creamy, nicely-incorporated vinaigrette you're after. Whisk in 1 Tbsp. water to thin the dressing out a bit. Season with salt to taste, and add another splash of vinegar if you like\u2014it should taste good and punchy.",
        "Prep your other salad ingredients. Slice 1 pint cherry tomatoes in half and transfer to a medium bowl. Slice 2 cucumbers into thin coins and transfer to bowl with tomatoes. Separate lettuce leaves and arrange on a large platter. Cover the lettuce with damp paper towels and chill in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to assemble.",
        "Heat a dry cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Pat steak dry again (the salt will have drawn out some moisture). Seriously: You want the meat to be as dry as possible, which is key to getting the handsome, crusty sear you're after. Rub steak with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. When we're searing things like steak or chops, we like to oil the surface of the meat rather than the surface of the pan\u2014this allows us to use less oil, and also cuts down on (the inevitable) smoke that comes with this kind of cooking. Speaking of which, this is a good time to turn on the vent above your stove, open a window, and/or get ready to (temporarily!!) deactivate your smoke detector .",
        "Using tongs, gently lay steak in preheated pan. Cook undisturbed\u2014as in, resist the urge to futz with it!\u2014until a golden brown crust forms, about 3 minutes. Turn steak and cook on second side for another 3 minutes.",
        "Turn steak to sear around thinner sides and fat cap until browned, then continue to cook 1 minute per side until steak is medium-rare in the center, 3-5 minutes longer. If you have an instant-read thermometer and you\u2019re uncertain about doneness, insert it into the center of the steak and look for a reading of 120-125\u00b0. Continue to cook until you get there.",
        "Remove skillet from heat. Transfer steak to cutting board briefly to rest. Wipe out skillet with a paper towel to remove any blackened oil. Let skillet cool 1-2 minutes, then heat over medium-low. Have a spoon close at hand. Return steak to skillet. Add 2 Tbsp. butter and 2 sprigs thyme and tilt skillet toward you so butter foams and pools along one side. Make sure thyme is swimming in the butter so it can really infuse. Use spoon to scoop up foamy butter and baste over top of steak constantly until butter is fragrant and browned, about 1 minute. Transfer steak to cutting board. It should rest at least 10 minutes\u2014you never want to cut into a steak without resting first, otherwise it will lose a lot of juiciness.",
        "Build your salad: Remove platter of lettuce from refrigerator; season with salt and pepper. (We always like to season our greens before we dress them.) Whisk dressing to combine and drizzle about half over lettuce.",
        "Season tomatoes and cucumbers with salt and pepper. (In case you haven't noticed by now, making sure to season all of your components is key.) Toss with a couple of tablespoons of dressing and arrange in a row along one side of lettuce.",
        "Halve 1 avocado, remove pit, and thinly slice. Fan out slices and arrange over top of lettuce in another row opposite tomatoes and cukes.",
        "Once steak has rested, thinly slice crosswise and shingle slices down across middle of platter. Season steak and avocado with more salt and pepper, then drizzle remaining dressing over avocado and steak. So fancy!"

        "Fill a large stock pot two-thirds full with water and heat over high to bring to a boil. Once you see the water start to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt. We know, we know: That looks like a LOT of salt. But salting the pasta water aggressively\u2014it should almost be seawater-salty\u2014is the key to making sure that every noodle is properly seasoned through and through, and is one reason why restaurant pasta tastes better than the stuff you usually make. While you wait for the water, start your sauce.",
        "Open a 28-oz. can of whole peeled tomatoes and drain contents in a colander set over medium bowl. (Whole peeled tomatoes are the only canned tomatoes worth buying, TBH. The diced ones sometimes have weird chemicals added to them to keep the chunks from breaking down. Gross.) Using clean fingers, poke a hole in the tomatoes and shake to drain liquid and seeds from the insides of each tomato, reserving liquid. Shake colander over bowl to separate the solids from all the juices and encourage liquid to drain; set aside.",
        "Smash 4 garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef\u2019s knife forcefully, so garlic breaks up into smaller bits; remove skins. If the cloves are really big, you might need to give them an extra smack to make sure they're broken up, but don't bother chopping\u2014the garlic will infuse into the oil you sizzle it in and break down as the sauce simmers.",
        "Working next to your pasta pot, heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. (We like using a Dutch oven or a large, high-sided skillet for cooking sauce and finishing pasta; it's kind of the only thing big enough to toss a whole pound of pasta in without noodles flying everywhere.) Add garlic and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until garlic is golden all over, about 3 minutes.",
        "Stir in a pinch of red pepper flakes, then add drained tomatoes and increase heat to medium-high. The idea here is to concentrate the flavor of those tomato solids before adding the liquid they came in, which will give your sauce a more complex, rounded flavor. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are darkened in color, browned and caramelized in spots, and starting to break down, 6-8 minutes. Don't rush this part! If you aren't getting color, let it go for another few minutes. Mash with the back of the wooden spoon to form a coarse paste.",
        "Add reserved tomato liquid to pot and stir to combine. Season with a pinch of salt, throw in 3 basil sprigs, and reduce heat so sauce is bubbling at a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced and sauce is thick like applesauce, 8-10 minutes. If your water isn\u2019t boiling yet, turn off heat under sauce while you wait. If it is, reduce heat to lowest setting and move on.",
        "Add 1 lb. pasta to pot of water and agitate with tongs to prevent sticking. Cook pasta, tossing occasionally, just until lower end of time range given on the package for al dente. If you're not sure if it's done, fish out a piece and take a nibble\u2014it should still be slightly too crunchy to want to eat because it's going to continue cooking in the tomato sauce. Just before pasta is done, use a heatproof measuring cup to scoop out about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.",
        "Using tongs, transfer pasta from stock pot into Dutch oven with sauce, allowing water to piggyback on pasta into sauce. (That's right, no draining!) Crank heat under sauce up to medium-high and pour in 1/2 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid. If you've never finished cooking pasta in a pan full of sauce, your life is about to be changed\u2014this process is what ensures that every single noodle is completely coated and infused with saucy goodness, and is pretty much the main difference between a dish of \"meh\" pasta and one that blows your mind.",
        "Cook pasta, tossing constantly, until sauce is clinging to each noodle and any standing liquid is mostly absorbed, about 1 minute. You still want a saucy consistency, but not watery. If things ever start to look a little dry, just add another splash of that pasta cooking water; if they look too wet, just wait a bit for some more liquid to evaporate.",
        "Slowly sprinkle in half of the Parmesan cheese (you want the grainy stuff with the texture of shaky cheese, not Microplaned), tossing constantly, until it has melted into the sauce. Add more pasta water, a couple of tablespoons at a time, to loosen sauce if necessary\u2014it should be plenty saucy while you're incorporating the cheese so it emulsifies into the sauce properly. You want the sauce to ooze but still be thick enough to coat the pasta.",
        "Remove pot from heat and stir in 2 Tbsp. butter until melted. Finishing with a bit of butter is almost always a good idea\u2014it makes the finished dish extra glossy and delicious. (Don't look at us like that\u2014if you think pasta is diet food, you're kidding yourself.)",
        "Using tongs, divide pasta among bowls, then top with remaining cheese and basil leaves. Top with red pepper flakes and an extra drizzle of oil, if you feel. And there you have it: saucy, glossy Basically Spaghetti Pomodoro. Give yourself a pat on the back, and kiss the jarred stuff goodbye."

        "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0. Prep your ingredients before you start cooking. First, coarsely chop 4 oz. bacon.",
        "Wash your cutting board (or just flip it over!) so that you're not cutting vegetables on the same surface that you used to prep raw meat. Peel 1 onion and cut into quarters; set one quarter aside for the relish. Cut remaining quarters into large pieces.",
        "Rinse 1 3\" piece ginger, then very thinly slice crosswise (no need to peel).",
        "Place 4 short ribs on a plate; season all over with salt and pepper, turning pieces to season every surface.",
        "Heat a Dutch oven over medium-low. Add bacon and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp, 7-10 minutes. Meanwhile, line a medium bowl with paper towels. Using wooden spoon, transfer bacon to a medium bowl, leaving fat in pot. Blot bacon with paper towels, then discard paper towels, leaving bacon in bowl.",
        "Increase heat to medium-high and add short ribs. Cook, turning once or twice, until very well browned on at least two sides, 12-15 minutes (it\u2019s not necessary to brown all over as long as you get a sear on a couple sides).",
        "Transfer short ribs back to plate and reduce heat to medium. Add ginger and onion pieces to pot and cook, stirring often, until ginger is just starting to turn golden around the edges, about 3 minutes.",
        "Add 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup rice vinegar, 2 Tbsp. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. Sriracha, and 1 cup water; stir to combine. Arrange short ribs in Dutch oven in a single layer (it\u2019s okay if they\u2019re not fully submerged in liquid).",
        "Cover pot and transfer to oven. Bake 30 minutes, then remove pot from oven and turn short ribs with tongs.",
        "Cover pot and return to oven. Continue to bake, turning every 30 minutes, until short ribs are fork-tender and pulling away from the bone, 60-70 minutes longer.",
        "Transfer short ribs to a platter. Tent with foil to keep warm.",
        "Heat pot with juices over medium-high and bring to a boil. Cook until braising liquid is reduced by about half, 8-12 minutes.",
        "While juices are reducing, thinly slice reserved onion quarter. Add 1 cup pineapple chunks and sliced onion to bowl with bacon. Season lightly with salt and toss with remaining 1 Tbsp. rice vinegar.",
        "Place a strainer over a heatproof measuring cup and pour reduced juices through strainer. Discard solids. Let juices settle until fat rises to the top. Spoon off fat and discard.",
        "Pour de-fatted juices over short ribs. Spoon bacon-pineapple relish over meat and top with 1/4 cup cilantro.",
        "Do Ahead: Short ribs can be braised 1 day ahead. Let cool in (unreduced) braising liquid, cover, and chill. Reheat over low, then proceed with recipe. If making ahead, we recommend crisping fresh bacon for the relish."

Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper, turning with tongs; set aside while you do your prep (it can sit at room temperature up to 1 hour, but prep won\u2019t take you that long).",

        "Lay pork in skillet and cook, leaving it be, until first side is dark brown and caramelized all over, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook second side until browned, about 3 minutes longer. Turn pork chop upright and hold on its side with tongs to sear fat cap; cook about 2 minutes.",
        "Turn heat to low and cook chop another minute on both sides. Transfer to cutting board and insert an instant-read thermometer into middle of chop, about 1/2\" from bone. It should register about 130\u00b0. If it\u2019s under, cook another minute or two, then let rest on cutting board 5-10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.",

        "Slip blade of a paring knife underneath loosened cross-hatched peach skin and peel back to remove. If peels are stubbornly stuck, use a vegetable peeler. Cut peaches into wedges; discard pits.",
        "Blend peach flesh, 2/3 cup jam, 1/4 cup mint leaves, and 2 Tbsp. lemon juice in a blender on highest speed until smooth. Leave blender jar on the base because you\u2019re about to come back to it.",
        "Gently heat saucepan with gelatin mixture over low, swirling, just until granules dissolve and mixture is translucent. Don\u2019t blast the heat because this can destroy the setting power of the gelatin and it might ignite the bourbon! Keep it low.",

        "Transfer peach mixture to a large bowl and chill in freezer, stirring with a spatula every 5 minutes, until mixture is thick enough that you can see the bottom of bowl as you stir (be sure to scrape against sides and bottom of bowl with spatula where mixture has become more solid), 15-20 minutes total. As it cools, gelatin will start to set and mixture will thicken.",
        "While peach mixture hangs out in freezer, whip 11/2 cups cream and a pinch of salt in another large bowl with a whisk. You can do this in a mixer, but in a large bowl starting with cold cream, it should only take a few minutes by hand. Work in a vigorous figure-eight pattern, switching hands if needed, until cream firmly holds marks of whisk and gently slumps into a soft, cloud-like peak as it falls off whisk. Chill cream as you wait for peach mixture to thicken.",
        "When peach mixture is ready, place it next to bowl of whipped cream on your work surface. Whisk about one-third of cream into peach mixture until incorporated.",
        "Scrape peachy cream back into bowl with plain cream. Using spatula, fold it all together until barely any streaks remain. At this point you want to work fairly quickly so cream doesn\u2019t deflate and mousse stays nice and light.",
        "Spoon mixture into serving glasses, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and chill until gelatin is completely set, at least 4 hours.",
        "About 15 minutes before serving, slice 2 peaches into thin wedges and toss in a medium bowl with remaining 1/4 cup jam and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice.",
        "Spoon peach wedges and their jammy juices over set mousse and garnish with mint sprig.",
        "Do Ahead: Mousse can be made 2 days ahead. Keep covered and chill."

You\u2019re going to cook the quinoa like pasta, so the exact quantity of water doesn\u2019t matter\u2014just make sure saucepan is at least half full. Add 1/2 cup quinoa and return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook at a gentle boil or lively simmer, uncovered, until you start to see the curly tail separate from the individual grains, 12-15 minutes. Even though you\u2019re cooking the quinoa uncovered, you\u2019re going to use the lid later, so make sure it\u2019s within reach.",
        "Taste quinoa and make sure it\u2019s tender. If it\u2019s still a little crunchy, cook another 2 minutes, then taste again. Once tender, drain quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer-keep saucepan close at hand-and shake off as much excess water as possible. Turn off your stove.",
        "Immediately dump drained quinoa back into saucepan. Return to stove and cover, placing 2 layers of paper towels underneath lid. The paper towel is there to absorb liquid as quinoa continues to steam, making it fluffy instead of wet and soggy. Let sit on stove (make sure the burner is turned off) while you assemble the rest of the salad.",
        "Hold head of broccoli by the stalk in your non-dominant hand over a large bowl. Rotating the stalk as you work, use your knife to shave off thin layers from the floret end, holding knife almost parallel to the buds and taking off just the tiny buds at first. Then use knife to shave off thin layers of the florets until you reach the thicker stems.",
        "You\u2019re going to trim and chop up the stalk because it\u2019s (arguably) the most delicious part of the broccoli. Start by snapping off any remaining stems sticking out of the stalk. Using a vegetable peeler, remove fibrous outer layer of stalk until you get to the tender light green interior (you may have to go around with peeler several times). Chop up stalk and add to bowl.",
        "Toss in 6 dates, 3 scallions, 4 oz. cheese, 1/3 cup almonds, 11/2 tsp. red pepper, and quinoa. Add several generous pinches of salt and toss to combine.",
        "Add 1/4 cup oil and 3 Tbsp. lemon juice and toss to combine. Taste and add more salt, if needed.",
        "Cover salad with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface. Let salad sit at least 30 minutes before serving (or transfer salad to an airtight container and chill up to 3 days). This allows the dates to soften and other ingredients to soak up all the lemon juice, oil, and seasonings.",
        "Before serving, toss salad together, then taste and season with more salt and lemon juice, if needed."

        "Remove brisket from its packaging and pat dry with paper towels. Lay brisket flat on your cutting board so that one of the longer sides is closest to you and layer of white fat is facing down. Take a close look at the meat itself\u2014you\u2019ll notice that there are long \u201cgrains\u201d (thread-like muscle fibers) running left to right across length of brisket. You are going to \u201cslice against the grain,\u201d which means positioning your knife blade perpendicular to the direction of the fibers, into 2\"-wide pieces. You do this so that when you go to shred the meat at the end, the fibers don\u2019t stretch a mile long and they\u2019re a manageable length for sandwiches.",
        "Place brisket halves in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt, brown sugar, and cumin. Use your hands to really massage the meat and work in all the salt and spices so every little spot is coated. Get in there! Set brisket aside for a moment.",
        "Mix onion, garlic, vinegar, soy sauce, Worcestershire, 2/3 cup Sriracha, and 1 cup water in a large Dutch oven or stockpot.",
        "Using tongs, nestle brisket into pot so fattier sides are facing up and pieces fit together in a single layer. The meat should be barely submerged in liquid, so add a little more water if that\u2019s not the case (depending on size of your pot).",
        "Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to achieve a very gentle simmer.",
        "Cover pot and cook brisket, peeking inside occasionally to make sure heat isn\u2019t too high or low\u2014you want a couple of areas in the pot to be gently bubbling. If bubbles are roiling all over the place, reduce heat. If you see no bubbles at all, increase slightly. If liquid drops below top of meat, add a little more water to keep barely submerged.",
        "After 2 hours, check meat for doneness. Poke a fork into a few pieces and twist the tines to see if the meat will easily separate into shreds. If not, that means it\u2019s still tough. Keep cooking, checking again every 15 minutes or so. This could take up to an hour more.",
        "Turn off heat and position lid so that it\u2019s cracked open a bit. Let brisket cool until no longer steaming hot, about 30-40 minutes. Cover and chill overnight.",
        "The next day, remove pot from refrigerator and uncover. There will be an layer of solidified orange fat on the surface (the color is from the Sriracha!). Using a fork, lift off fat in large pieces and discard.",
        "Reheat brisket in pot over low until meat is warmed all the way through, 30-40 minutes. Transfer meat to a rimmed baking sheet. If meat is too hot to touch, let cool for a few minutes until you can handle it.",
        "Using your fingers or 2 forks, separate muscle fibers into shreds and return to pot. Remove any pieces of fat and discard.",
        "Return pot to low heat and bring liquid to a gentle simmer, tossing meat with tongs to encourage it to soak up juices. Add more Sriracha to taste.",

        "Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and cover pot. Simmer, lifting lid occasionally to stir and poking pieces of pork with a fork to test for tenderness after the first half hour, until tender, 45-60 minutes. When you lift the lid, you want to see gentle bubbles. If you see rapid bubbling or no bubbling at all, adjust your heat accordingly.",
        "While pork is cooking, prep the rest of your ingredients. Drain 14 oz. tomatoes in a colander or strainer. Smash 2 garlic cloves and discard skins. Peel 1 red onion and thinly slice about a quarter of it. Place slices on the side of cutting board and cover with a damp paper towel. Coarsely chop remaining onion. Pick about 1 cup cilantro leaves with tender stems and cover with a damp paper towel on cutting board. Run knife through remaining cilantro to coarsely chop (stems included).",
        "Combine drained tomatoes, garlic, 2 chipotle chiles, 2 tsp. agave syrup, coarsely chopped onion, and coarsely chopped cilantro in a blender. Cut 1 lime in half and squeeze in juice. Blend on high until salsa is smooth (you should have about 13/4 cups). Season with salt.",
        "Check to make sure pork is fork-tender. When you slide tines of a fork into a piece and twist, the fibers will easily separate. At this point, uncover pot and increase heat to medium. Let pork bubble away until water is evaporated, 10-15 minutes.",
        "At this point, the pork will begin to sputter and splatter. To protect yourself from the burning hot flying pork fat, place lid back on pot slightly ajar and increase heat to medium-high. After about 2 minutes of the pork sizzling in its own fat, reduce heat to low and lift lid to check on it. You want the undersides of the pieces to be browned and crispy. If they\u2019re not, put the lid back on and increase heat again. Cook for another minute or two.",
        "Once pork is browned on first side, use a spatula to loosen and turn pieces by scraping bottom. Put lid back on slightly cockeyed and crank heat again until second side is browned, 2-3 minutes. Repeat process of covering and browning meat, then uncovering and turning pieces, once or twice more until browned and crispy all over. Remove pot from heat.",

Slice 12 oz. mozzarella into planks that are no more than 1/4\" thick. Peel 1 shallot and cut crosswise into thin rings. Place shallot rings in a small bowl. Cut lemon in half and squeeze halves into bowl. Add a pinch of salt and toss; set aside.",

Strip kale leaves off the thick woody ribs and tear into small pieces; discard ribs. Finely grate 2 oz. Parmesan using the small holes of a box grater. Set aside about 1/2 cup cheese for garnishing.",
        "Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or large skillet, preferably with straight sides, over medium-high. It\u2019s best to use a vessel with high sides, because you\u2019re about to do a lot of tossing and flinging when the pasta goes in, and this will minimize spillage. Add sausage and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until meat is browned, crispy in places, and cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Transfer with a spider or slotted spoon to a plate. Remove pot from heat and set aside.",
        "Pour 12 oz. pasta into water and stir once. Set timer for 3 minutes less than the package advises. You\u2019re going to cook it well shy of al dente.",
        "While pasta is cooking, return pot to medium-low heat and add beans and 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes. Cook, tossing occasionally and mashing some beans with spoon, until browned in spots, about 5 minutes. Transfer about half of beans to plate with sausage.",
        "Using a ladle or liquid measuring cup, add about 1 cup cooking liquid from pasta into pot with beans (reserve remaining liquid). Increase heat to medium-high.",
        "Using spider or a slotted spoon, transfer pasta to pot with beans and add kale. Toss vigorously with tongs to move the pasta around to incorporate the kale as it wilts.",
        "Continue to cook, tossing often, until kale is wilted, pasta is al dente, and water is reduced by about half, about 4 minutes. If water is reduced before pasta is al dente, add another 1/4-1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid. Reduce heat to low.",
        "Add another 1/4 cup pasta cooking liquid, then gradually add cheese, tossing all the while, until cheese is emulsified into the water and forms a luxurious, glossy sauce.",
        "Remove pot from heat and add reserved beans and sausage, then 2 Tbsp. butter, tossing, until butter is melted.",
        "Taste pasta and add more salt if needed. Cut 1 lemon in half and squeeze one half over pasta, then drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil.",
        "Divide pasta among bowls and top with reserved 1/2 cup cheese."

        "Meanwhile, prep your other ingredients. Pull 6 eggs out of the fridge and place in a medium bowl. Cover them with hot tap water and let sit to take the chill off (cold eggs will crack when you drop them in boiling water). Cut 1 lemon in half. Grate 1 oz. Parmesan on the medium holes of a box grater. If your box grater has the side that makes thin, flat shavings, use that side. Transfer cheese to a small bowl and cover with a wet paper towel to prevent drying out.",
        "Place 11/2 pounds potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with cold water by about 2\". Add a small fistful of salt and bring to a boil over medium heat.",
        "When potatoes are boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and bring liquid to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are tender, 15-20 minutes. Test them for doneness after 15 minutes by using a skewer or fork to pierce one of the larger potatoes. The skewer should slide into the center easily with little resistance.",
        "Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer potatoes to a large bowl. If water in pot has reduced below the halfway point, top off with more water and bring back to a boil.",
        "Carefully lower eggs into pot with slotted spoon or spider (reserve bowl they were just in) and immediately set the timer for 8 minutes (this will give you medium-cooked eggs; if you like a drier yoke, set the timer for 9-10 minutes).",
        "While the eggs are cooking, fill bowl formerly occupied by eggs with ice water.",
        "When the timer goes off, immediately lift eggs out of water with spider or slotted spoon and plunge into ice water. Let cool a few minutes, then remove eggs from water and peel.",
        "If you\u2019re not using any appliances and want to make the pesto by hand, skip to step 11. Mix toasted walnuts and 3/4 cup basil leaves in a food processor, chopper, or blender. Pulse 4-5 times until walnuts are chopped. Use a microplane to grate in 1 garlic clove, then zest of a lemon half.",
        "Add 1/2 cup oil and all but about 2 Tbsp. cheese (reserve for serving). Squeeze in juice of zested lemon half. Pulse again a few times until incorporated and nuts are finely chopped. Season with salt and pepper and pulse just once or twice more to combine.",
        "If you\u2019re not using a food processor, finely chop walnuts and 3/4 cup basil together on cutting board. Transfer to a medium bowl and finely grate 1 garlic clove and zest of a lemon half into bowl. Add 1/2 cup oil and squeeze in juice from zested lemon half; stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper; set aside.",

        "You know when you hear chefs talking about \u201cmise en place,\u201d or the process of prepping all your ingredients? Well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re about to do. Cut 1 lemon into wedges and slice off white strip at the point of each wedge, also cutting out seeds (discard white part and seeds). Set wedges aside. Separate leaves of 1 romaine heart and wash/dry if necessary. Tear any large leaves into pieces. Strip oregano leaves from stems; discard stems. Set aside 1 Tbsp. oregano leaves. Finely chop the rest and transfer to a large bowl. Cut 1 cup cherry tomatoes in half.",
        "Finely grate 2 garlic cloves into bowl with chopped oregano. Add 1 tsp. salt, several dashes of hot sauce, and 1 Tbsp. cold water.",
        "Add 1 lb. lamb and use 1 clean hand to knead mixture, simultaneously rotating bowl with your other hand, to incorporate. Knead until a light film forms on side of bowl and mixture holds together in a single mass and is very firm (it will spring back when pressed), about 1 minute.",
        "Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high until oil is shimmering. Carefully add lamb mixture and press into a single flat layer with a flexible spatula (a fish spatula works great for this).",
        "Cook meat, undisturbed, until underside is browned and crisp around the edges, 5-7 minutes. Watch out for splatter and reduce heat slightly if mixture is splattering a lot.",
        "Using spatula, break patty into smaller pieces and turn. Cook pieces on the other side until edges are crisp and meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes.",
        "Remove skillet from heat and transfer lamb to a clean large bowl with spatula, then break up meat into small pieces with end of spatula.",
        "Pour off all but a thin layer of fat from skillet into a small heatproof bowl and reserve. Return skillet to medium heat. Working one or two pitas at a time (depending on size of pitas and skillet), cook pitas until underside is golden and crisp around the edges, 1-2 minutes. You only want to crisp 1 side. Transfer pitas to cutting board crisped side down. Add an extra splash of reserved fat to skillet and repeat with remaining pitas.",
        "Finely grate remaining garlic clove into a small bowl and add 3/4 cup yogurt and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Season with salt and squeeze 2 or 3 lemon wedges into bowl. Stir with a spoon to combine.",

Spoon crispy lamb over lettuce, dividing entire mixture evenly. Top with tomatoes, also dividing evenly. Drizzle yogurt sauce over. Dust with an extra sprinkle of salt, then top with reserved oregano leaves. Add hot sauce to taste and serve with remaining lemon wedges alongside."

        "Using a fork, stir 1 egg, 1/2 cup panko, 1/4 cup feta brine, half of crumbled feta, half of parsley, 4 Tbsp. harissa, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a large bowl until egg is blended and mixture looks homogenous.",
        "Finely grate 2 garlic cloves into bowl, then add 1 tsp. salt and several cranks of black pepper. Be pretty generous here; 10 cranks wouldn\u2019t be too much! Stir again with a fork.",
        "Add chicken and work with clean hands until chicken is totally intermingled with panko mixture. Work it enough so that you don\u2019t see big distinct pieces of meat, but then stop. Overworking could lead to crumbly meatballs. The mixture will feel very soft and wet and look a bit shiny.",
        "Pour tomatoes and chickpeas into the center of a large rimmed baking sheet. Add 2 Tbsp. oil and remaining 2 Tbsp. harissa. Season with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Using clean hands or a small spatula, toss everything together right on sheet until chickpeas and tomatoes are evenly coated. Next you\u2019re going to form the meatballs, but don\u2019t wash your hands if you used them\u2014the coating of oil will prevent them from sticking to your palms.",
        "Roll chicken mixture gently and loosely between your palms into about 16 golf ball-sized balls (it\u2019s okay if the balls aren\u2019t perfectly round; just try to make them about the same size). Place on baking sheet, tucking them in and around chickpeas and tomatoes and spacing evenly apart.",
        "Bake meatballs on top rack until about halfway cooked through, 12-15 minutes. Remove from oven and take a look. The tomatoes should be starting to soften and burst, and the meatballs should look opaque and feel a bit springy to the touch. If not, bake a few minutes longer.",
        "Meanwhile, combine remaining 3 oz. feta, 1/3 cup parsley, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl, then grate in remaining garlic clove. Toss with fork to distribute. Turn on broiler (to high if your broiler has settings).",
        "Place baking sheet back on top rack if your broiler is on the top of your oven. If you have the kind that\u2019s a drawer underneath the oven, slide \u2018er right in. Broil meatballs, rotating tray once or twice if they\u2019re browning unevenly, until browned and fully cooked through, some tomatoes are lightly charred, and some chickpeas are crisp, 8-10 minutes.",
        "Let sit a few minutes, then sprinkle feta mixture over meatballs.",
        "Do Ahead: Meatballs can be formed on baking sheet 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and chill."

Cut larger ones in half and set aside on cutting board. Cut 6 of the 8 scallions into 1\" pieces. Thinly slice remaining 2 scallions and set aside on your board. Pull skin and bones off 1/2 rotisserie chicken and discard. Shred meat with your fingers and set aside on your cutting board. Cut 1 lime into wedges and set aside.",
        "Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium until shimmering. Add 2 whole corn cobs, 1\" pieces of scallions, and tomatillos (cut side up).",
        "Cook, rotating corn and tomatillos and tossing scallions occasionally, until vegetables are lightly charred all over. This will happen at different times. The scallions and tomatillos will cook fastest, 3-4 minutes. As they\u2019re done, transfer them to a large bowl.",
        "The corn will take longest, 8-12 minutes total, so keep rotating cobs. When corn is lightly charred all over, transfer to cutting board and let cool; keep skillet close by because you\u2019re going to use it again in a few minutes.",
        "Pick a small handful of cilantro leaves with tender stems and set aside. Transfer tomatillos and charred scallions to a blender and add 6 rings of pickled jalapen\u0303os (or more if you like it spicy), remaining cilantro, and 2 Tbsp. water. Starting on low speed and eventually increasing to high, blend until mixture is completely smooth. With the motor running, stream in remaining 2 Tbsp. oil to emulsify. Season salsa with salt; set aside.",
        "Take a few minutes to cut kernels off of the now-cool-enough-to-handle corn cobs. Do this directly on cutting board.",

        "Still working over medium-low heat, fold in all but a handful of 9 oz. tortilla chips, turning mixture with spatula and breaking up chips into smaller pieces until coated. Make sure to scrape around sides of skillet to incorporate any remaining sauce. If you\u2019re using a thicker tortilla chip, there should be just enough sauce to coat all the chips in a thin layer. If you\u2019re using thinner chips, there\u2019s a chance the mixture will be a little dry, so we recommend adding in batches and holding back some chips if there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough sauce.",
        "Remove skillet from heat and tuck remaining chips into top.",

Cut 1 avocado in half, remove pit, and scoop flesh out of skins with a spoon. Cut into slices and arrange over top of skillet. Dollop with sour cream mixture and top with remaining cilantro sprigs.",

        "Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0. Cut off stem end of 1 globe eggplant, then shave a thin slice off of fattest part of bulbous end. Rest eggplant on newly cut side so it doesn\u2019t roll around your board.",
        "Cut eggplant crosswise into 1/2\"-thick slices.",
        "Repeat same process with 2 zucchini and/or summer squash, trimming stem end, shaving side and resting on flat surface, and slicing crosswise 1/2\" thick.",
        "Arrange eggplant slices in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet, then fit as many pieces of zucchini as possible on same baking sheet, tucking into spaces around eggplant.",
        "Place remaining zucchini slices on one half of another rimmed baking sheet, arranging as close together as possible and in a single layer.",
        "On empty side of baking sheet, arrange 24 oz. tomatoes and 8 garlic cloves. Drizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over tomatoes and garlic and toss with your hands to coat.",
        "Using your hands, smear 2 Tbsp. oil over exposed sides of eggplant and zucchini slices. Eggplant in particular acts like a sponge and will soak up oil in an instant. Since all you want is a thin, even coating, it\u2019s better to smear them with oil rather than to drizzle.",
        "Still using your hands, turn eggplant and squash slices over and smear other side with 2 Tbsp. oil. Season all vegetables on both baking sheets with a couple of 4-finger pinches of salt.",
        "Place sheet with eggplant on lower rack and sheet with tomatoes on upper rack and roast until eggplant is deeply browned on the underside and tomatoes are lightly blistered, 15-25 minutes.",
        "Remove both baking sheets from oven. You\u2019ll notice that the vegetables will have shrunk quite a bit. On baking sheet with eggplant, slide a flexible metal spatula underneath ALL slices and turn them over. Slide rounds over to one side, then transfer zucchini from sheet with tomatoes onto sheet with eggplant, turning them over in the process. You should end up with tomatoes and garlic on one baking sheet, and eggplant and zucchini on the other.",
        "Let baking sheet with tomatoes cool, but return baking sheet with eggplant and zucchini to lower rack and roast until second side of eggplant is deeply browned, 10-15 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle.",
        "Meanwhile, combine 8 oz. ricotta, 3/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, and 6 oz. mozzarella in a medium bowl. Drizzle with oil and mix with a fork to combine; season lightly with salt.",
        "Using a fork, remove garlic cloves from baking sheet and transfer to a cutting board. Press on skins to force out the soft, caramelized cloves; discard skins. Mash cloves to a paste with fork, then stir into ricotta mixture.",
        "Drizzle some oil into a shallow 2-qt. baking dish. Arrange one-third of zucchini and eggplant slices in a single layer. Scatter one-third of blistered tomatoes over, then dollop half of ricotta mixture over tomatoes. Tear one-third of basil leaves and scatter over ricotta.",
        "Repeat layering process with half of remaining eggplant and zucchini, all of remaining ricotta mixture, and half of remaining tomatoes and basil. Top with remaining eggplant, zucchini, and tomatoes.",
        "Sprinkle remaining 2 oz. mozzarella over and bake until mozzarella is melted and browned in spots and liquid around the edges is bubbling, 15-20 minutes.",
        "Let rest 10 minutes, then top with remaining basil.",
        "Drizzle with a little more oil before serving."

        "Halve both onions through root end. Using the tip of your knife, cut a V-shaped notch around root to remove it (this will ensure that all slices separate when you cut the onion).",
        "Place 1 onion half on your cutting board so root end is facing you, then thinly slice onion lengthwise, starting at one side and working all the way to the other (so your knife runs through the root halfway through, not starting or ending at the root end). You\u2019re going for slices that are 1/4\"-1/8\" thick.",
        "Repeat same slicing procedure for remaining onion halves. It\u2019s a lot of onion! But it will cook down quite a bit, so it\u2019s best to start with a large quantity.",
        "Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium until melted and sizzling. You can use a skillet to cook the onions, but a pan with high sides will keep the onions from flipping out onto your stove. Using a pan that also has a wide base gives water room to evaporate, allowing the onions to caramelize rather than steam.",
        "Instead of dumping in all of the onions at once, which would fill the pot and make it hard to stir (which would then cause the ones on the bottom to cook faster), start by adding just a couple of large handfuls to the pot. Cook, stirring, until onions are soft and starting to turn translucent, 1-2 minutes. Stir in a few more handfuls of onion and repeat cooking and stirring process until you\u2019ve added all the onions. Season with a pinch of salt.",
        "Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook onions, stirring every few minutes to prevent them from sticking and coloring too much in any one place, until blonde-colored, 15-20 minutes. This is the point of doneness for French onion soup! If you feel like onions are getting too brown around the edges or they\u2019re sticking, reduce your heat a bit.",
        "If you\u2019re going for onions that are both softer and more caramelized (say for a patty melt or onion dip), keep cooking, stirring on the regular, until onions are unmistakably golden brown, another 15-20 minutes. Because most of the water has cooked off at this point, there might be some bare spots where the pot could start to burn. If this happens, stir in a splash of broth or water. The liquid will dissolve the cooked-on bits, which the onions will re-absorb.",
        "For extra-dark onions, the kind that make a great burger topping, cook until they start to almost blacken around the edges and go slightly crisp, another 10-15 minutes. This requires constant attention so they don\u2019t burn. No one said caramelized onions were quick!",
        "Let onions cool in the saucepan, then use or transfer to an airtight container and chill. They will keep up to 1 week."
