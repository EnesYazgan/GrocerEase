        "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0. Trim the ends off of 1 onion. Cut in half through root end, peel and discard skin, then coarsely chop. (No need to sweat the knife work here\u2014it's all going to get blended anyway.) Transfer chopped onion to a medium bowl.",
        "Using the flat side of chef\u2019s knife, smash 3 garlic cloves. Peel and discard skins, then coarsely chop. Transfer to the bowl with the chopped onion.",
        "Using a spoon, peel 2\" piece ginger. (We always like to use a spoon to peel ginger, which is way better for navigating all of those nooks and crannies than a vegetable peeler.) Thinly slice and add to bowl with onion and garlic.",
        "Trim a handful of cilantro leaves with tender stems; set aside for serving. Coarsely chop remaining stems and transfer about \u00bc cup chopped stems to bowl with onion. Clear your cutting board.",
        "It\u2019s time to break down your squash! (We promise it\u2019s not as scary as it sounds.) Trim off both ends of 1 butternut squash, then cut through where the neck meets the bulb. (This makes it easier to peel.) Peel both pieces of squash with a vegetable peeler. Cut squash neck and bulb in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop out seeds from each half of the bulb; discard seeds. Place squash pieces cut side down on board and cut each piece in half lengthwise. Cut squash crosswise into 1\"-thick slices. Again, you don't need to worry about beautiful knife work here, but it's good for the pieces to be similarly sized so they cook at the same rate.",
        "Vigorously shake 13.5-oz. can of coconut milk for a few seconds so everything gets well mixed. Open can and set aside 3 Tbsp. milk to swirl over finished soup.",
        "Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or saucepan over medium. Add onion mixture, \u00bc tsp. red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp. salt and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until onion is translucent and soft, 5\u20137 minutes.",
        "Add squash and give everything a stir to coat. Add 3 cups water, or enough to just submerge the squash, remaining coconut milk in can, and 2 tsp. salt, then stir to combine. Raise heat to high and bring soup to a boil.",
        "Once soup is boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very tender, 12\u201314 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, prepare your garnishes. Spread \u00bd cup coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast in oven until golden brown, about 5 minutes. (If you can't find big coconut flakes, shredded is okay, too, but it will probably take less time to toast. Just make sure to avoid any pre-sweetened stuff.) Keep an eye on them\u2014coconut flakes can go from golden to burnt in seconds. Cut 1 lime into wedges; set aside for serving. Using a fork or citrus reamer, juice the second lime into a small bowl.",
        "You\u2019re almost ready to blend\u2014so let\u2019s do this! First things first: set up your workstation. You\u2019ll need your pot of soup, blender, a large bowl, a ladle, and a clean kitchen towel all within arm\u2019s reach. Using ladle, fill blender pitcher no more than halfway with equal parts broth and vegetables (if you fill it up, it will overflow as it blends!). Now, here\u2019s the most important step of this entire recipe: When you secure the blender lid, make sure there is a vent for the steam to escape (many blender lids come with removable vents). If you skip this step, the lid will blow off and you will end up with soup on every inch of your kitchen.",
        "Holding the lid down with a folded kitchen towel, carefully blend soup, starting from the lowest speed and working your way up to high, until smooth and silky, 10\u201315 seconds. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat, working in batches, until all soup is blended.",
        "Wipe out Dutch oven and return to stove. Pour soup back into pot and heat over medium, stirring occasionally, until you can see steam rising from the pot. (You may be tempted to serve the soup straight from the blender, but it loses a lot of heat in the blending process and gets lukewarm. Trust us\u2014you want to reheat it.) Stir in lime juice. Taste and add more salt if needed.",
        "Ladle soup into bowls. Top with a swirl of reserved coconut milk, toasted coconut flakes, and cilantro. Serve with reserved lime wedges."

        "Melt \u00bd stick butter in a small saucepan or microwave in a small bowl.",
        "Place 1 3\u20134-lb. whole chicken on a cutting board (best to use a plastic one you can sterilize). A word on bird size. A 3\u20134-lb. chicken is pretty much the ideal size for roasting this way. Something a little bit bigger will work, but once you get much past 4\u00bd-lbs. it becomes harder to guarantee that the breast meat won't dry out in the time it takes the dark meat to cook. Pat the whole thing dry with paper towels. It's super important to get the chicken as dry as possible, which helps with browning.",
        "With chicken breast facing up and legs pointing toward you, use a sharp knife to slice through loose area of skin connecting the leg and breast, making about a 3\"-long incision. Continue cutting downward until you hit the joint that connects the thigh to the body, then stop (once you get through the skin, there\u2019s not much there; if you are cutting through flesh, you\u2019re too close to the breast). This exposes the leg joint, making it easy to tell if chicken is cooked. Repeat on second side.",
        "Season every surface of chicken, including skin along backbone, inside cavity, under wings, and inside part of the leg you just exposed, with lots of salt and pepper. If you\u2019re using kosher salt, it should take you 4\u20135 generous\u2014as in, four finger\u2014pinches, which will be around 4 whole teaspoons.",
        "Transfer chicken breast side up to a large oven-safe skillet. Arrange lemon and garlic cut sides down in skillet around chicken.",
        "Drizzle chicken all over with melted butter (mmmmmmm) and transfer to oven.",
        "Roast until chicken is nicely browned and cooked through, checking for doneness after 45 minutes. To check, carefully remove skillet from oven (the handle is hot!), poke a knife into leg joints, and pierce the meat. If juices run clear, the chicken is done. If you see a rosy pink color, it needs more time. Continue to roast, checking every 5 minutes, until juices run clear. (If you\u2019re not sure, you can also use the knife to lightly shred some of the meat along the thigh bone\u2014the meat should look opaque and the fibers should separate easily.)",
        "Let chicken rest in skillet at least 15 minutes before carving\u2014this will help the juices in the meat to settle, and will also get it down to a temperature that is cool enough to handle with your bare hands while carving. Don't worry: It's a big piece of meat, so it will still be plenty warm by the time you serve it. Transfer chicken to a platter. Pour all of those glorious, buttery pan juices over top of the meat and serve with roasted lemon and garlic alongside. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!",
        "Do Ahead: Chicken can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool. Cover and chill; bring to room temperature before serving."

        "Add 2 Tbsp. miso, 1 Tbsp. oil, 1 Tbsp. vinegar, 1 Tbsp. honey, and 1 Tbsp. water to the bowl with with the ginger. Whisk to combine and set aside. This is a great all-purpose sauce, so making extra wouldn't hurt! Use it to top grain bowls, roasted vegetables, or any other simply-cooked protein.",
        "Heat a small skillet over medium. Toast 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds, tossing frequently, until seeds are a light golden color and slightly fragrant, about 2 minutes. Seeds you toast yourself are always going to be more flavorful than the ones you buy already toasted, but we won't judge if you don't feel like going the extra mile.",
        "Trim the root ends from 3 scallions and thinly slice crosswise.",
        "Lightly season the flesh of 4 salmon fillets on all sides with salt. Place pieces skin side down in a cold\u2014as in not preheated; you don't have to refrigerate it or anything\u2014cast-iron skillet. (This might seem a little weird, but trust us\u2014the skin will render nicely and get way more crispy this way.) Heat skillet over medium and let the salmon cook undisturbed for 5 minutes.",
        "Press down lightly on flesh with a spatula to ensure all parts of the skin are making contact with the pan. At this point it should be opaque at least halfway up the flesh side. Continue to cook skin side down until fish is opaque all the way through and skin is crispy, about 5 minutes longer. If the skin is still sticking to the pan at this point, don't try to un-stick it\u2014you'll know that it's ready to flip when it releases on its own.",
        "Using a fish spatula, gently flip the fillets, then remove the pan from the heat. Continue to cook off-heat (the pan will still be plenty hot) until flesh is juuuuuuuust cooked through, about 1 minute longer for regular-sized fillets, but very thick ones might take up to 3 minutes more\u2014you can use a fork to flake the fish slightly to check for doneness; you're looking for the inside to be still a little pink and translucent.",

        "1 garlic clove",
        "2 lemons",
        "\u00bd cup plain full-fat yogurt",
        "\u00bc cup mayonnaise",
        "2 dashes hot sauce",
        "\u00bd tsp. kosher salt, plus more",
        "\u00bd tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more",
        "A small handful of mixed herbs, such as dill, basil, cilantro, and/or parsley",
        "\u00bc cup roasted, salted almonds",
        "1 head of romaine or 2 romaine hearts",
        "2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil"
    ],
    "steps": [
        "Peel 1 garlic clove and use a Microplane to finely grate into a medium bowl. If we're putting garlic into a dressing, we're almost always going to grate it. It's faster and easier than mincing by hand, and ensures that the garlic flavor is evenly dispersed.",
        "Slice 4 sides off 2 lemons. Cutting the lemons this way makes it easy to remove the seeds, and creates easy-to-squeeze \"cheeks.\" Squeeze juice from 1 lemon into bowl with garlic. Set remaining cheeks aside.",
        "Add \u00bd cup yogurt, \u00bc cup mayonnaise, 2 dashes hot sauce, \u00bd tsp. salt, and \u00bd tsp. pepper and whisk to combine. Give the dressing a taste and add more salt and pepper if necessary\u2014it should be plenty punchy.",
        "Remove leaves from any tough stems from handful of herbs. (You can use whatever soft herbs you have lying around for this, alone or in combination, but the dressing will taste great even without them.) Finely chop leaves, then stir into yogurt mixture.",
        "Crush \u00bc cup roasted, salted almonds with the bottom of a small pot or pan. You can certainly toast raw almonds yourself if you want some extra credit, but using ready-to-go nuts is a good option if you don't feel like turning on the oven. Don't like almonds? Any nut or seed will work great here, too.",
        "Cut off bottom of 1 head of romaine and let leaves fall from core; discard any leaves that are tough, leathery, or wilty. Continue cutting from the bottom, removing leaves as they fall.",
        "Once you have removed all the leaves, slice larger leaves in half and leave smaller ones whole. (If your leaves are dirty or gritty, this is a good time to give them a wash\u2014just remember to dry them off as thoroughly as possible afterward.) Transfer to a large bowl.",
        "Squeeze reserved lemon cheeks over lettuce and toss gently to coat. (We always dress with acid\u2014think citrus or vinegar\u2014before adding any oil, otherwise it will slide right off.) Add 2 Tbsp. oil and a generous pinch of salt; toss again to coat. If it seems like you're dressing this salad twice, well, you are! This ensures that each leaf of lettuce is properly seasoned before that creamy ranch gets drizzled on\u2014a pro move whenever you're dressing a salad.",
        "Arrange half of lettuce mixture on a platter. Spoon dressing over, then repeat with remaining lettuce and dressing. Top with almonds; season with plenty of pepper. Repeat every night from now on."

        "Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0. Finely grate 1 garlic clove into a medium bowl. Finely grate 1 more garlic clove into a small bowl. (The medium bowl is for your meatball mixture, and the small bowl is for your salsa verde, in case this part seems silly.)",
        "Finely chop 2 cups mixed herbs. As we mentioned in the ingredients list, you can use any combo of soft herbs like parsley, dill, basil, and/or cilantro, but if you've only got one that's cool, too\u2014we just love how green and complex they taste when mixed together. Transfer half to same medium bowl, then transfer remaining herbs to same small bowl.",
        "Finely chop 3 Tbsp. capers. Transfer 2 Tbsp. capers to medium bowl, then transfer remaining 1 Tbsp. capers to small bowl. Chop \u00bc cup walnuts and add to same medium bowl. If you've never added nuts to meatballs, you're in for a real treat; they lend great texture and flavor to the finished dish.",
        "Whisk in 1 egg, 1 Tbsp. paprika, 2 tsp. salt, and 1 Tbsp. oil to bowl with walnuts.",
        "Using clean hands, mix 1 cup panko into egg mixture. Add beef and continue to mix gently with your hands until incorporated, but do not overmix. This part is key\u2014if you work the mixture too much, the meat will become tough and springy, almost like sausage, so use a gentle hand. Also: At this point, you can pinch off a little piece of the meatball mixture, crisp it in a skillet, and give it a taste to make sure the seasoning is to your liking. This is your last chance to make any tweaks before they all get cooked!",
        "Drizzle 2 Tbsp. oil  on a rimmed baking sheet. Roll beef mixture into 1\u00bd\" balls (about the size of golf balls). Arrange 1\" apart on pan.",
        "Bake meatballs, shaking pan halfway through, until crispy on all sides, about 10 minutes. One cool thing about using all beef (instead of a beef-pork-veal combo) is that it's totally fine if the meatballs are a little pink in the middle.",
        "While meatballs are cooking, you can finish that salsa verde. This is one of our all-time favorite sauces, and is delicious spooned over just about any piece of meat, roasted veg, or bowl of leftovers you can think of. Which is all to say: Get ready to have a lot more salsa verde in your life from here on out. Finely grate lemon zest into bowl with herbs and garlic. Halve the lemon you just zested and squeeze juice into bowl, using your hand to catch any seeds. (You can use a citrus squeezer for this if you've got one.) Add remaining \u00bd cup oil and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and add more seasoning if necessary\u2014it should be good and punchy.",

        "\u00bc cup red wine vinegar",

        "Start by doing a little prep work. Peel and chop 1 onion and 1 carrot.",
        "Peel 3 garlic cloves by smashing each firmly with the flat side of a knife to break into smaller pieces. Discard skins. The cool thing about prepping garlic for any kind of long-cooking preparation like this is that it will have plenty of time to break down and infuse the whole soup with garlicky goodness, which means there's no need to go through the tedious process of mincing the cloves finely.",
        "Heat \u00bc cup oil in a large stock pot or Dutch oven over medium. Add onion, carrot, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is golden, 5\u20137 minutes. Don't worry if the veggies start sticking to the bottom of the pan a little bit\u2014that's a good thing! Those little browned bits have a ton of flavor, and we'll be adding some liquid in the next step to get them up, a process that's also called \"deglazing.\" Cool, huh?",
        "Add \u00bc cup red wine vinegar and cook, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pot, until vinegar is reduced by about half.",
        "Add 2 Tbsp. adobo sauce from can of chiles and stir to coat. (Feel free to add more adobo sauce if you're craving more heat and smokiness; just remember: You can always add more later, but you can't take any away.)",
        "Add 1 lb. dried black beans, 1\u00bd tsp. oregano, 1 Tbsp. salt, and 8 cups water. That's right: no boxed stock! The beans are going to create their own delicious broth as they simmer away. Bring up to a boil over high heat, then drop the heat down low so that the beans are just simmering. Cover pot with a lid.",
        "Simmer, stirring every 30 minutes to prevent sticking, until beans are tender and creamy, 1\u00bd\u20132 hours. How long it takes will depend entirely on how fresh your beans are\u2014the longer they've been sitting on the shelf, the longer they're going to take to cook. That's why we try to buy dried beans from stores where we know their inventory moves. (You can't always tell, but dust on the bag is never a good sign.) As the beans cook, you may need to top off with a bit more hot water if too much of it cooks off; you want to make sure the beans are submerged.",
        "Meanwhile, assemble your garnishes. They're going to be the difference between an extremely simple\u2014and delicious!\u2014pot of black bean soup and something that feels fun and kind of fancy. The first thing we're going to make is a kind of creamy lime-yogurt to dollop on top. First, place 1 cup yogurt in a small bowl. Finely grate zest from 1 lime into bowl. Cut the lime in half and squeeze in juice.",
        "Season yogurt mixture with salt. Give it a taste and add another pinch of salt if it doesn't pop. Easy, and kind of fancy, non? Cut remaining 2 limes into wedges for squeezing over the soup.",
        "Prepare any other (optional) garnishes you may like. Slice some ripe avocado. Put some Fritos or tortilla chips or corn nuts in a bowl. Pick some cilantro leaves. Chop some onion, or thinly slice some scallions. Shred some cabbage. If you ask us, the more garnishes, the better!",
        "Taste and season soup with salt, if needed. Remember: Beans can handle quite a bit of salt, so don't be afraid to add more if it tastes kind of \"meh.\" You can serve right away, but we usually like to let a bean soup like this hang out for at least a half hour after we've finished seasoning it so that the salt in the cooking liquid can work its way into the beans themselves. Ladle the soup into bowls, top with yogurt mixture, and serve with lime wedges and any other garnishes your heart desires.",
        "Do Ahead: Soup, without garnishes, can be made 1 week ahead; store in an airtight container and chill, or freeze up to 3 months."

        "Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Butter a 9x4\" loaf pan, fully coating bottom and sides. Line pan lengthwise with parchment paper, leaving about a 2\" overhang. Are you reading this and wondering, \"Can I use wax paper instead of parchment paper?\" The answer is: absolutely NOT. That strip of parchment paper will help you to lift the finished cake out of the loaf pan cleanly. Wax paper, on the other hand, will melt and stick to the cake\u2014it's never meant to go into the oven. Now you know!",
        "Using a Microplane, finely grate the zest from 2 lemons into a large bowl. Add 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted room temperature butter and 1 cup granulated sugar to bowl. It might be tempting to ignore the part about the butter being \"room temperature,\" but working with butter that's soft and spreadable\u2014but not melted\u2014is essential here.",
        "Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat until mixture is very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. You know how people talk about \"creaming\" butter and sugar together? That's what you're doing here. You're basically whipping a bunch of air into the butter and sugar mixture, which will help keep the finished cake light and fluffy. And as we mentioned in the last step, that butter needs to be room temp in order for this to work.",
        "Beat in 3 eggs one at a time, waiting until each is incorporated before adding the next. Continue to beat until mixture is lighter and even fluffier, about 2 minutes.",
        "Whisk 1\u00be cups all-purpose flour, 1\u00bd tsp. baking powder, and \u00bd tsp. salt in another large bowl. It might seem funny to add salt to a dessert recipe, but a little bit helps to make all of the rich, sweet elements really sing.",
        "Add one-half of dry ingredients to butter mixture and beat on low speed just until combined.",
        "Beat in 6 Tbsp. milk on low just until smooth, then add remaining dry ingredients and beat just until combined. Now that you've added the flour, you want to mix the batter as little as possible\u2014if you beat it up too much, you'll start to form gluten, which will make the cake tough. Using a spatula, scrape down sides of bowl and give batter a final mix so dry ingredients are fully incorporated.",
        "Scrape batter into your buttered loaf pan; smooth top with a spatula. Bake cake, turning once halfway through, until a cake tester, toothpick, skewer, or thin knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 45-55 minutes.",
        "While the cake bakes, make the glaze: First, remove zest from remaining lemon with a vegetable peeler in wide strips. (FWIW, if this part seems overly fussy or annoying, you can feel free to just use a Microplane to zest all of the lemons for the glaze, but we think doing it this way looks cuter.)",
        "Transfer zest to a cutting board and slice as thinly as possible; set aside.",
        "Halve 2 lemons (the ones you already zested) and squeeze the juice into a small bowl with a reamer or fork (you should have about \u00bd cup lemon juice).",
        "Place 1\u00bd cups powdered sugar in another medium bowl. Slowly whisk in about half of lemon juice until smooth, then add sliced lemon zest; set glaze aside.",
        "Let cake cool about 10 minutes. (Yeah, it really does need to cool a bit, so set a timer if you're impatient.) Poke 10-15 holes evenly throughout cake with a cake tester or toothpick. Pour the remaining lemon juice\u2014the stuff that didn't end up going into the glaze\u2014over the top of the cake. Let cool completely. (Seriously!)",
        "Run a butter knife around edges of pan to loosen. Using parchment overhang, lift cake onto a wire rack; remove parchment.",
        "Now, pour the lemon zest glaze over cake, letting it fall down the sides. Let icing set for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Serve on its own, or with a spoonful of Greek yogurt, a dollop of whipped cream, or a scoop of ice cream on top. (You deserve it!)"

        "\u00bd cup large unsweetened coconut flakes",
        "2 limes",
        "A small handful of cilantro",
        "Basmati or jasmine rice (for serving)"
    ],
    "steps": [
        "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0. Pat 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Moisture is the enemy of well-browned meat, so it's super important to get them as dry as possible before searing them. Season generously on all sides with 1 Tbsp. salt.",
        "Okay, this is going to seem a little bit out there, but trust us: It works. Place a cold, dry large Dutch oven on the stove\u2014no heat yet! Nestle all of your chicken thighs in there, skin side down, so that there is as much skin-to-pan contact as possible (it's fine if they're crowded together). Then turn the heat under the pan to medium. As the pan becomes hotter and hotter, the skin will start to release some of its fat and then get extra crispy and brown, a process that will probably take around 15\u201320 minutes. (Try not to fuss with the thighs too much while this is happening, just let them be. This is a good time to do some of the prep work outlined in the next few steps.) When the skin is deeply browned\u2014we're only cooking the skin side right now\u2014use tongs to transfer the thighs skin side up to a plate. Turn off the heat under the Dutch oven, but reserve it\u2014we're going to build our braise in it, and we want all of that fat and any browned, stuck-on bits, which will lend richness and flavor to the finished dish.",
        "While chicken is browning, do some prep: First, peel 2 onions and cut them in half through the root end. Slice 3 of the onion halves into 3 wedges each, and set the remaining half aside for later.",
        "Smash 3 garlic cloves with the flat side of a knife and remove the peel.",
        "Using a spoon, peel 2\" piece ginger. (Peeling knobby ginger with a vegetable peeler is a pain, but a spoon can get into all of those little nooks and crannies much more easily. Use a Microplane to finely grate the ginger into a small bowl.",
        "Cook onion wedges in the reserved pot\u2014the same one you seared the chicken in\u2014over medium heat, stirring often, until golden brown in spots and translucent, 4\u20136 minutes.",
        "Now you're going to start building the base for your braise. First, add your garlic and ginger and cook just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 2 Tbsp. curry powder, stirring to coat until fragrant, a minute or two more. Deglaze the pan by adding a splash of water, vigorously stirring to loosen and dissolve brown bits on bottom of the pot. Add half of coconut milk (shake it well before you open the can, as it can separate!), followed by 1 cup water. Bring the liquid up to a simmer.",
        "Chicken time! Arrange the thighs, skin side up, in the Dutch oven so that the meat is partially submerged in the braising liquid. Cover and transfer to the oven to bake for 30 minutes.",
        "While the chicken does its thing, you're going to make a zippy coconut condiment for spooning over the finished dish. (Who doesn't love a good topping?) Start by spreading \u00bd cup coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet and placing it in the oven along with the chicken. Bake coconut until golden brown, about 5 minutes\u2014it'll go fast, so set a timer and keep an eye on it.",
        "Now, finely chop the reserved half onion from earlier and transfer to a small bowl.",
        "Finely grate zest of 1 lime into bowl of chopped onions. There's a ton of flavor in citrus peel, so it's always good to try to find a way to use it if you can. Cut the now-zested lime into wedges and squeeze the juice over onion mixture. Cut remaining lime into 4 wedges and save those for serving later.",
        "Cut off the bottom inch of stem from a small handful of cilantro, then finely chop up the stems until you get to the leaves; reserve leaves for serving. Add stems and toasted coconut to bowl with onion mixture (don\u2019t toss the mixture just yet, otherwise the coconut will get soggy).",
        "Peel 3 sweet potatoes and cut into 2\" pieces.",
        "After 30 minutes, uncover Dutch oven and add potatoes and remaining coconut milk. Use tongs to move things around so that the the vegetables are submerged underneath the chicken thighs, which you want to have arranged skin side up. Return the pot to the oven\u2014uncovered this time\u2014and cook until the sweet potatoes are soft enough that they can be pierced with a knife and the chicken is tender, another 15\u201330 minutes. (This is a good time to start your rice. If you don't have a rice cooker, this is our go-to stovetop rice cooking method.). After this amount of time, the chicken should be tender, juicy, and nicely cooked, but you can let it go for another 30-45 minutes if you're after a more shreddable, falling-apart tender result.",
        "Meanwhile, toss coconut condiment with \u00bd tsp.salt.",
        "And there you have it! Serve chicken thighs, curry sauce, and veggies over rice. Top with coconut condiment and reserved cilantro leaves, and serve with lime wedges alongside for squeezing.",
        "Do Ahead: Braised chicken can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Reheat over low heat before serving."

        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. (Higher heat = more caramelization, more quickly.) Remove bottom 2\" of tough stem from 1 head of broccoli with a chef\u2019s knife; discard. Cut broccoli crosswise, starting with the stem end (yep, you can eat most of the stem!) into \u00bc\" slices. When you reach the crown, slow your slicing so you can push the florets to the side as they begin to fall with each slice. You want to have lots of loose florets. No matter what kinds of veggies you're roasting, you want to cut them into pieces that are about the same size so that they cook at the same(ish) rate.",
        "Transfer broccoli to a rimmed baking sheet. (If you don't have a proper, heavy-duty aluminum half sheet pan, this is a reminder to invest in one ASAP.) Drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil; season with 1 tsp. salt and toss to coat. If you were interested in adding any spices\u2014think curry powder, chile flakes, fennel seeds\u2014this is the time to do it.",
        "Arrange broccoli on pan in a single layer, spacing so no pieces overlap (this ensures broccoli will roast properly, not just steam). Roast until nicely browned, even charred in spots, and crispy with a bright green interior, 8\u201310 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, make your tahini sauce. Cut 1 lemon in half. Using a citrus juicer (or your hands), juice lemon (fish out any seeds) into a small bowl. Cut remaining 1 lemon into wedges; set aside for serving. Peel 1 garlic clove and use a Microplane to grate it into bowl with lemon juice. (We're big fans of grated garlic over here, especially when it comes to dressings and sauces. It's a hell of a lot easier than trying to get a fine, even mince with a knife, and there's no risk of biting into a big chunk of raw garlic later on.)",
        "Add 5 Tbsp. tahini, 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp. salt, and \u00bc cup hot water and whisk until smooth. Give it a taste: The richness of the tahini and zippiness from the lemon should be nicely balanced, so adjust with more of either if necessary, and don't be afraid to add more salt if the sauce doesn't pop.",
        "Gently toss broccoli by giving pan a shake (or use a spatula). Continue to roast until browned in spots and tender, 5\u20138 minutes longer. As with all recipes, the amount of time it takes is going to have a lot to do with the equipment you're using\u2014you want that broccoli to have plenty of color on it, so don't be afraid to keep roasting until you get there.",
        "Heat a small skillet over medium. Toast 2 Tbsp. sesame seeds, tossing frequently, until light golden and slightly fragrant, about 2 minutes. Don\u2019t walk away; the seeds will burn quickly! Let cool. (And, FWIW, this recipe will still be good if you skipped the sesame seeds\u2014but if you're going to use them, make sure to toast them, which will make them a lot more flavorful. Cool?)",
        "Transfer broccoli to a platter and drizzle with tahini sauce. Top with sesame seeds and reserved lemon wedges for squeezing over. One of the great things about roasted vegetables is that they're just as delicious room temperature as they are piping hot, so don't stress if the rest of dinner isn't ready yet."

    "ingredients": [
        "1 1\u00bd\"-thick boneless New York strip steak (about 12 oz.)",
        "Kosher salt",
        "Freshly ground black pepper",
        "1 small shallot",
        "1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard",
        "1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar",
        "6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
        "1 pint cherry tomatoes",
        "2 Persian cucumbers",
        "1 head of butter lettuce",
        "2 Tbsp. unsalted butter",
        "2 sprigs thyme",
        "1 ripe avocado"
    ],
    "steps": [
        "Pat steak dry with paper towels and place on a clean plate. Season very generously all over with salt and pepper. (Think four-fingered pinches of salt\u2014rich proteins like steak need a lot more salt than you might think.) Let it sit at room temperature while you prep your other salad components, at least an hour if possible. (Don't worry: It's safe, and a room-temperature steak will cook more evenly than it will straight out of the fridge.)",
        "Salad dressing time! Peel and finely chop 1 shallot and transfer to a medium bowl. Add 1 Tbsp. mustard and 1 Tbsp. vinegar and whisk to combine. Here comes the fun part: Whisking constantly, slowly stream in 5 Tbsp. olive oil until dressing is thick and emulsified. The word \"slowly\" is key here\u2014if you add the oil all at once, you won't get the creamy, nicely-incorporated vinaigrette you're after. Whisk in 1 Tbsp. water to thin the dressing out a bit. Season with salt to taste, and add another splash of vinegar if you like\u2014it should taste good and punchy.",
        "Prep your other salad ingredients. Slice 1 pint cherry tomatoes in half and transfer to a medium bowl. Slice 2 cucumbers into thin coins and transfer to bowl with tomatoes. Separate lettuce leaves and arrange on a large platter. Cover the lettuce with damp paper towels and chill in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to assemble.",
        "Heat a dry cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Pat steak dry again (the salt will have drawn out some moisture). Seriously: You want the meat to be as dry as possible, which is key to getting the handsome, crusty sear you're after. Rub steak with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. When we're searing things like steak or chops, we like to oil the surface of the meat rather than the surface of the pan\u2014this allows us to use less oil, and also cuts down on (the inevitable) smoke that comes with this kind of cooking. Speaking of which, this is a good time to turn on the vent above your stove, open a window, and/or get ready to (temporarily!!) deactivate your smoke detector .",
        "Using tongs, gently lay steak in preheated pan. Cook undisturbed\u2014as in, resist the urge to futz with it!\u2014until a golden brown crust forms, about 3 minutes. Turn steak and cook on second side for another 3 minutes.",
        "Turn steak to sear around thinner sides and fat cap until browned, then continue to cook 1 minute per side until steak is medium-rare in the center, 3\u20135 minutes longer. If you have an instant-read thermometer and you\u2019re uncertain about doneness, insert it into the center of the steak and look for a reading of 120\u2013125\u00b0. Continue to cook until you get there.",
        "Remove skillet from heat. Transfer steak to cutting board briefly to rest. Wipe out skillet with a paper towel to remove any blackened oil. Let skillet cool 1\u20132 minutes, then heat over medium-low. Have a spoon close at hand. Return steak to skillet. Add 2 Tbsp. butter and 2 sprigs thyme and tilt skillet toward you so butter foams and pools along one side. Make sure thyme is swimming in the butter so it can really infuse. Use spoon to scoop up foamy butter and baste over top of steak constantly until butter is fragrant and browned, about 1 minute. Transfer steak to cutting board. It should rest at least 10 minutes\u2014you never want to cut into a steak without resting first, otherwise it will lose a lot of juiciness.",
        "Build your salad: Remove platter of lettuce from refrigerator; season with salt and pepper. (We always like to season our greens before we dress them.) Whisk dressing to combine and drizzle about half over lettuce.",
        "Season tomatoes and cucumbers with salt and pepper. (In case you haven't noticed by now, making sure to season all of your components is key.) Toss with a couple of tablespoons of dressing and arrange in a row along one side of lettuce.",
        "Halve 1 avocado, remove pit, and thinly slice. Fan out slices and arrange over top of lettuce in another row opposite tomatoes and cukes.",
        "Once steak has rested, thinly slice crosswise and shingle slices down across middle of platter. Season steak and avocado with more salt and pepper, then drizzle remaining dressing over avocado and steak. So fancy!"

        "2 Tbsp. unsalted butter"
    ],
    "steps": [
        "Fill a large stock pot two-thirds full with water and heat over high to bring to a boil. Once you see the water start to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt. We know, we know: That looks like a LOT of salt. But salting the pasta water aggressively\u2014it should almost be seawater-salty\u2014is the key to making sure that every noodle is properly seasoned through and through, and is one reason why restaurant pasta tastes better than the stuff you usually make. While you wait for the water, start your sauce.",
        "Open a 28-oz. can of whole peeled tomatoes and drain contents in a colander set over medium bowl. (Whole peeled tomatoes are the only canned tomatoes worth buying, TBH. The diced ones sometimes have weird chemicals added to them to keep the chunks from breaking down. Gross.) Using clean fingers, poke a hole in the tomatoes and shake to drain liquid and seeds from the insides of each tomato, reserving liquid. Shake colander over bowl to separate the solids from all the juices and encourage liquid to drain; set aside.",
        "Smash 4 garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef\u2019s knife forcefully, so garlic breaks up into smaller bits; remove skins. If the cloves are really big, you might need to give them an extra smack to make sure they're broken up, but don't bother chopping\u2014the garlic will infuse into the oil you sizzle it in and break down as the sauce simmers.",
        "Working next to your pasta pot, heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. (We like using a Dutch oven or a large, high-sided skillet for cooking sauce and finishing pasta; it's kind of the only thing big enough to toss a whole pound of pasta in without noodles flying everywhere.) Add garlic and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until garlic is golden all over, about 3 minutes.",
        "Stir in a pinch of red pepper flakes, then add drained tomatoes and increase heat to medium-high. The idea here is to concentrate the flavor of those tomato solids before adding the liquid they came in, which will give your sauce a more complex, rounded flavor. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are darkened in color, browned and caramelized in spots, and starting to break down, 6\u20138 minutes. Don't rush this part! If you aren't getting color, let it go for another few minutes. Mash with the back of the wooden spoon to form a coarse paste.",
        "Add reserved tomato liquid to pot and stir to combine. Season with a pinch of salt, throw in 3 basil sprigs, and reduce heat so sauce is bubbling at a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced and sauce is thick like applesauce, 8\u201310 minutes. If your water isn\u2019t boiling yet, turn off heat under sauce while you wait. If it is, reduce heat to lowest setting and move on.",
        "Add 1 lb. pasta to pot of water and agitate with tongs to prevent sticking. Cook pasta, tossing occasionally, just until lower end of time range given on the package for al dente. If you're not sure if it's done, fish out a piece and take a nibble\u2014it should still be slightly too crunchy to want to eat because it's going to continue cooking in the tomato sauce. Just before pasta is done, use a heatproof measuring cup to scoop out about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.",
        "Using tongs, transfer pasta from stock pot into Dutch oven with sauce, allowing water to piggyback on pasta into sauce. (That's right, no draining!) Crank heat under sauce up to medium-high and pour in \u00bd cup reserved pasta cooking liquid. If you've never finished cooking pasta in a pan full of sauce, your life is about to be changed\u2014this process is what ensures that every single noodle is completely coated and infused with saucy goodness, and is pretty much the main difference between a dish of \"meh\" pasta and one that blows your mind.",
        "Cook pasta, tossing constantly, until sauce is clinging to each noodle and any standing liquid is mostly absorbed, about 1 minute. You still want a saucy consistency, but not watery. If things ever start to look a little dry, just add another splash of that pasta cooking water; if they look too wet, just wait a bit for some more liquid to evaporate.",
        "Slowly sprinkle in half of the Parmesan cheese (you want the grainy stuff with the texture of shaky cheese, not Microplaned), tossing constantly, until it has melted into the sauce. Add more pasta water, a couple of tablespoons at a time, to loosen sauce if necessary\u2014it should be plenty saucy while you're incorporating the cheese so it emulsifies into the sauce properly. You want the sauce to ooze but still be thick enough to coat the pasta.",
        "Remove pot from heat and stir in 2 Tbsp. butter until melted. Finishing with a bit of butter is almost always a good idea\u2014it makes the finished dish extra glossy and delicious. (Don't look at us like that\u2014if you think pasta is diet food, you're kidding yourself.)",
        "Using tongs, divide pasta among bowls, then top with remaining cheese and basil leaves. Top with red pepper flakes and an extra drizzle of oil, if you feel. And there you have it: saucy, glossy Basically Spaghetti Pomodoro. Give yourself a pat on the back, and kiss the jarred stuff goodbye."

Blot bacon with paper towels, then discard paper towels, leaving bacon in bowl.",

    ],
    "steps": [
        "First things first: Get some prep work out of the way before your date arrives. Season 1 lb. pork loin chop (1\u20131\u00bd\" thick) and let it sit out at room temperature (it cooks much more evenly that way). Pat chop dry with paper towels and place on a plate. Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper, turning with tongs; set aside and let sit on the counter while you work on all the other dishes.",
        "Next you\u2019re going to pivot to dessert prep. It\u2019ll only take you a few minutes, but you want to let the Dutch baby batter rest while you make the rest of the dinner. Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400\u00b0. Place a dry medium skillet on rack to preheat.",
        "Whisk 3 eggs, \u2153 cup flour, \u00bc cup sugar, 3 Tbsp. cocoa powder, and \u00be tsp. salt in a medium bowl until smooth.",
        "Whisking constantly, slowly stream \u00bd cup milk into egg mixture. Cover with plastic and let batter rest.",
        "Now, for the appetizer. Drain 4 oz. olives and place on a cutting board. Lightly smash with the heel of your hand just to break apart skin and flatten slightly. Smash 3 garlic cloves and peel. Using a vegetable peeler, remove peel from 1 lemon in long wide strips. Save remaining lemon for later (you\u2019re going to use it with the pork).",
        "Cook lemon peel, olives, garlic, \u00bd cup oil, and \u00bd tsp. red pepper flakes in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling occasionally, until garlic is sizzling and golden around the edges, 5\u20137 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, crumble 3 oz. feta into a shallow serving bowl.",
        "Pour oil mixture over feta. Let sit at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour.",
        "When your date shows up and you're ready to serve the appetizer, tear bread into large pieces and place in oven directly on rack next to skillet. Bake until craggy edges are golden, 5\u20138 minutes. Place bowl of marinated feta and olives on a large plate, and set bread alongside for dipping.",
        "Oh, you fancy, huh? Give yourself a pat on the back, pour a couple glasses of something bubbly, and be your charming self. Whose great idea was it to stay in on Valentine's Day? That's right: yours.",
        "After you've done a little snacking and schmoozing, do a little more casual dessert prep. Chop 1 oz. chocolate on cutting board. Wash out small saucepan you just used and transfer chocolate to saucepan. Add \u00bc cup cream and cook over low heat, whisking often, until chocolate is melted and mixture is completely smooth; season with a pinch of salt. Keep warm over low heat.",
        "You\u2019re doing great! Now, on to the main event. Prep your ingredients for the pork dish: Shave 1 oz. Parmesan with a vegetable peeler, then use your fingers to break into small shards. Cover with a damp paper towel (to prevent it from drying out). Using the bottom of another medium skillet, preferably cast iron, smash 3 Tbsp. hazelnuts, a few at a time, on cutting board, breaking into bits. Peel 1 shallot, then finely chop. Separate leaves from 1 large or 2 small endive, trimming from the bottom as you work your way to the core. Place in a medium bowl, cover with damp paper towel, and chill until ready to use.",
        "Preheat skillet you used to smash hazelnuts over medium heat. Drizzle \u00bd tsp. honey over one side of pork chop, then drizzle with 1 Tbsp. oil. Rub with clean hands all over surface of chop, then turn and rub second side with same honey-oil mixture to evenly coat; this will help pork caramelize as you cook it. Speaking of which, if you don't have a decent hood above your stove, this might be a good time to open a window and turn on a box fan, because things are about to get a liiiiiittle...smoky.",
        "Lay pork in skillet and cook, leaving it be, until first side is dark brown and caramelized all over, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook second side until browned, about 3 minutes longer. Turn pork chop upright and hold on its side with tongs to sear fat cap; cook about 2 minutes.",
        "Reduce heat to low and cook chop on both sides 1 more minute. Transfer to cutting board and insert an instant-read thermometer into middle of chop, about \u00bd\" from bone. It should register about 130\u00b0. If it\u2019s under, cook 1\u20132 more minutes, then let rest on cutting board 5\u201310 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.",
        "Add hazelnuts and 2 Tbsp. oil to skillet. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring with tongs, until hazelnuts turn golden, about 3 minutes.",
        "Add shallot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until shallots are softened and browned and hazelnuts smell toasty, about 2 minutes.",
        "Stir in remaining 2 tsp. honey. Cut zested lemon in half and squeeze juice from one half into skillet. Stir to combine, then remove from heat.",
        "Cut around core of 1 apple, removing flesh in 3 lobes. Thinly slice 2 of the 3 pieces, then snack on the remaining piece if you like.",
        "Remove bowl of endive from refrigerator and add apple and cheese; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, squeeze second lemon half over, and toss to coat.",
        "Cut bone away from chop and cut meat into \u00bd\"-thick slices. Place pork and bone on one side of a large plate and pour juices over; season with salt.",
        "Light a couple of candles and pour some glasses of that red wine: It's almost dinner time.",
        "Gently arrange salad next to chop. Spoon shallot-hazelnut mixture over salad and pork and serve. Give yourself a round of applause, because this dinner looks goooooood.",
        "When you\u2019re ready to move on to dessert, remove skillet from oven (watch that hot handle!) and add 1 Tbsp. butter; swirl skillet to melt, making sure to coat entire bottom and sides of skillet.",
        "Give batter a quick whisk to reincorporate, then pour into skillet. Quickly transfer to oven, taking care because the handle is hot.",
        "Bake until pancake is dramatically puffed and edges are curling inward toward center but center is still moist, 10\u201312 minutes. Remove skillet from oven (watch for that handle again) and let rest about 2 minutes. The pancake will immediately begin to fall, but that\u2019s normal. Meanwhile, pull ice cream out of freezer to let it soften slightly.",
        "Top with 2 scoops ice cream and drizzle with warm chocolate sauce; serve warm.",
        "And you have our permission to save the dishes for tomorrow..."

    "ingredients": [
        "\u00bc cup chilled bourbon",

        "Pour \u00bc cup bourbon into a small saucepan and sprinkle 1 packet gelatin over. Let soak to soften gelatin, about 10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, score skins of 1 lb. peaches with a sharp knife in a large \u201cX\u201d pattern on pointy (non-stem) end and place in a colander in sink. (If you\u2019re using frozen peaches, skip this and proceed with step 5.)",
        "Heat a kettle (or saucepan) full of water until water boils, then pour over peaches to loosen skin. Rinse peaches in cold water.",
        "Slip blade of a paring knife underneath loosened cross-hatched peach skin and peel back to remove. If peels are stubbornly stuck, use a vegetable peeler. Cut peaches into wedges; discard pits.",
        "Blend peach flesh, \u2154 cup jam, \u00bc cup mint leaves, and 2 Tbsp. lemon juice in a blender on highest speed until smooth. Leave blender jar on the base because you\u2019re about to come back to it.",
        "Gently heat saucepan with gelatin mixture over low, swirling, just until granules dissolve and mixture is translucent. Don\u2019t blast the heat because this can destroy the setting power of the gelatin and it might ignite the bourbon! Keep it low.",
        "Stream gelatin mixture into blender with the motor on low speed.",
        "Transfer peach mixture to a large bowl and chill in freezer, stirring with a spatula every 5 minutes, until mixture is thick enough that you can see the bottom of bowl as you stir (be sure to scrape against sides and bottom of bowl with spatula where mixture has become more solid), 15\u201320 minutes total. As it cools, gelatin will start to set and mixture will thicken.",
        "While peach mixture hangs out in freezer, whip 1\u00bd cups cream and a pinch of salt in another large bowl with a whisk. You can do this in a mixer, but in a large bowl starting with cold cream, it should only take a few minutes by hand. Work in a vigorous figure-eight pattern, switching hands if needed, until cream firmly holds marks of whisk and gently slumps into a soft, cloud-like peak as it falls off whisk. Chill cream as you wait for peach mixture to thicken.",
        "When peach mixture is ready, place it next to bowl of whipped cream on your work surface. Whisk about one-third of cream into peach mixture until incorporated.",
        "Scrape peachy cream back into bowl with plain cream. Using spatula, fold it all together until barely any streaks remain. At this point you want to work fairly quickly so cream doesn\u2019t deflate and mousse stays nice and light.",
        "Spoon mixture into serving glasses, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and chill until gelatin is completely set, at least 4 hours.",
        "About 15 minutes before serving, slice 2 peaches into thin wedges and toss in a medium bowl with remaining \u00bc cup jam and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice.",
        "Spoon peach wedges and their jammy juices over set mousse and garnish with mint sprig.",
        "Do Ahead: Mousse can be made 2 days ahead. Keep covered and chill."

        "Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat. You\u2019re going to cook the quinoa like pasta, so the exact quantity of water doesn\u2019t matter\u2014just make sure saucepan is at least half full. Add \u00bd cup quinoa and return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook at a gentle boil or lively simmer, uncovered, until you start to see the curly tail separate from the individual grains, 12\u201315 minutes. Even though you\u2019re cooking the quinoa uncovered, you\u2019re going to use the lid later, so make sure it\u2019s within reach.",
        "Taste quinoa and make sure it\u2019s tender. If it\u2019s still a little crunchy, cook another 2 minutes, then taste again. Once tender, drain quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer\u2013keep saucepan close at hand\u2013and shake off as much excess water as possible. Turn off your stove.",
        "Immediately dump drained quinoa back into saucepan. Return to stove and cover, placing 2 layers of paper towels underneath lid. The paper towel is there to absorb liquid as quinoa continues to steam, making it fluffy instead of wet and soggy. Let sit on stove (make sure the burner is turned off) while you assemble the rest of the salad.",
        "Hold head of broccoli by the stalk in your non-dominant hand over a large bowl. Rotating the stalk as you work, use your knife to shave off thin layers from the floret end, holding knife almost parallel to the buds and taking off just the tiny buds at first. Then use knife to shave off thin layers of the florets until you reach the thicker stems.",

Using a vegetable peeler, remove fibrous outer layer of stalk until you get to the tender light green interior (you may have to go around with peeler several times). Chop up stalk and add to bowl.",

You are going to \u201cslice against the grain,\u201d which means positioning your knife blade perpendicular to the direction of the fibers, into 2\"-wide pieces. You do this so that when you go to shred the meat at the end, the fibers don\u2019t stretch a mile long and they\u2019re a manageable length for sandwiches.",

If bubbles are roiling all over the place, reduce heat. If you see no bubbles at all, increase slightly. If liquid drops below top of meat, add a little more water to keep barely submerged.",
        "After 2 hours, check meat for doneness. Poke a fork into a few pieces and twist the tines to see if the meat will easily separate into shreds. If not, that means it\u2019s still tough. Keep cooking, checking again every 15 minutes or so. This could take up to an hour more.",
        "Turn off heat and position lid so that it\u2019s cracked open a bit. Let brisket cool until no longer steaming hot, about 30\u201340 minutes. Cover and chill overnight.",

        "Without separating or peeling the cloves, cut entire head of garlic in half through the \u201cequator\u201d (it\u2019s fine if some cloves become detached). Thinly slice 1 green chile, removing seeds if desired for less heat.",
        "If you got whole chicken legs (if not, go to the next step), cover surface of cutting board with a double layer of plastic wrap and place legs skin side up on top (this is to protect your board from any possible contamination; if you have a cutting board that you use for raw meat, use that). You\u2019re going to split the legs into thighs and drumsticks. Working one leg at at time, wiggle drumstick so you can see the joint connecting the thigh and drumstick. Slice down with your knife crosswise between the two, aiming for the joint, until you hit bone. Grasp leg with thigh in one hand and drumstick in the other and break the joint, then cut the rest of the way through with your knife. Repeat with remaining legs.",

Add chicken skin side down and cook, lifting pieces with tongs once or twice toward the end to let hot fat flow underneath, until fat is rendered and skin is crisp and golden brown, 7\u201310 minutes. Transfer skin side up to a plate. Because drumsticks are covered entirely in skin, you can brown both sides, but it\u2019s not necessary.",
        "Add \u00be cup vinegar, \u00be cup soy sauce, 1 Tbsp. brown sugar, 5 bay leaves, and reserved garlic and sliced chile to Dutch oven. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, stirring to dissolve sugar. Season generously with pepper.",

        "While chicken is simmering, cook 1 cup rice in medium pot according to package directions.",
        "Transfer chicken to a clean plate. Increase heat to medium-high and boil braising liquid, shaking pot often, until liquid has formed a rich sauce thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat and return chicken to pot, turning to coat in sauce.",

    "steps": [
        "Coarsely chop 6 oz. bacon and transfer to a Dutch oven. Cut 1\u00bd lb. pork shoulder into 1\u00bd\"-thick pieces and add to pot. Add 1\u00bd tsp. salt and cover meat with water\u2014not so much water that the pieces are bobbing around, but you want them almost entirely submerged.",
        "Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and cover pot. Simmer, lifting lid occasionally to stir and poking pieces of pork with a fork to test for tenderness after the first half hour, until tender, 45\u201360 minutes. When you lift the lid, you want to see gentle bubbles. If you see rapid bubbling or no bubbling at all, adjust your heat accordingly.",
        "While pork is cooking, prep the rest of your ingredients. Drain 14 oz. tomatoes in a colander or strainer. Smash 2 garlic cloves and discard skins. Peel 1 red onion and thinly slice about a quarter of it. Place slices on the side of cutting board and cover with a damp paper towel. Coarsely chop remaining onion. Pick about 1 cup cilantro leaves with tender stems and cover with a damp paper towel on cutting board. Run knife through remaining cilantro to coarsely chop (stems included).",
        "Combine drained tomatoes, garlic, 2 chipotle chiles, 2 tsp. agave syrup, coarsely chopped onion, and coarsely chopped cilantro in a blender. Cut 1 lime in half and squeeze in juice. Blend on high until salsa is smooth (you should have about 1\u00be cups). Season with salt.",
        "Check to make sure pork is fork-tender. When you slide tines of a fork into a piece and twist, the fibers will easily separate. At this point, uncover pot and increase heat to medium. Let pork bubble away until water is evaporated, 10\u201315 minutes.",
        "At this point, the pork will begin to sputter and splatter. To protect yourself from the burning hot flying pork fat, place lid back on pot slightly ajar and increase heat to medium-high. After about 2 minutes of the pork sizzling in its own fat, reduce heat to low and lift lid to check on it. You want the undersides of the pieces to be browned and crispy. If they\u2019re not, put the lid back on and increase heat again. Cook for another minute or two.",
        "Once pork is browned on first side, use a spatula to loosen and turn pieces by scraping bottom. Put lid back on slightly cockeyed and crank heat again until second side is browned, 2\u20133 minutes. Repeat process of covering and browning meat, then uncovering and turning pieces, once or twice more until browned and crispy all over. Remove pot from heat.",
        "Warm tortillas by grasping with tongs and waving them over a gas burner, or wrap in damp paper towels and microwave 30 seconds.",

Rotate skillet to encourage even browning. Carefully lift up thighs to allow hot fat to run underneath. If thighs are stubborn and don\u2019t want to release, let them go a bit longer.",

Turn carrots so charred side is facing up, then season lightly with salt.",

        "While carrots are roasting, stir 2 Tbsp. soy sauce, 2 Tbsp. Sriracha, 1 Tbsp. rice vinegar, 1 Tbsp. honey, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl. Scrape peel off of ginger root with a spoon; discard peel. Grate ginger into bowl with microplane, then stir to combine.",

    "steps": [
        "The first thing you want to do is get your pasta water boiling. Fill a large pot (preferably around 8 quarts) with approximately 6 quarts water, then put it over high heat. When you see wisps of steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt, stir once, and cover the pot. This will make it boil faster. Yes, it\u2019s A LOT of salt, but as the pasta cooks, it absorbs the salty water, ensuring the pasta is seasoned from the inside out. You end up dumping most of the salt anyway when you drain the water.",
        "While the water comes to a boil, prep your other ingredients. Remove 3 links sausage from its casings and set aside. Dump 1 can beans into a strainer or colander and rinse well. Shake off excess water. Turn out beans onto a couple of sheets of paper towel and pat dry with a few more paper towels. Strip kale leaves off the thick woody ribs and tear into small pieces; discard ribs. Finely grate 2 oz. Parmesan using the small holes of a box grater. Set aside about \u00bd cup cheese for garnishing.",
        "Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or large skillet, preferably with straight sides, over medium-high. It\u2019s best to use a vessel with high sides, because you\u2019re about to do a lot of tossing and flinging when the pasta goes in, and this will minimize spillage. Add sausage and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until meat is browned, crispy in places, and cooked through, 8\u201310 minutes. Transfer with a spider or slotted spoon to a plate. Remove pot from heat and set aside.",
        "Pour 12 oz. pasta into water and stir once. Set timer for 3 minutes less than the package advises. You\u2019re going to cook it well shy of al dente.",
        "While pasta is cooking, return pot to medium-low heat and add beans and \u00bd tsp. red pepper flakes. Cook, tossing occasionally and mashing some beans with spoon, until browned in spots, about 5 minutes. Transfer about half of beans to plate with sausage.",
        "Using a ladle or liquid measuring cup, add about 1 cup cooking liquid from pasta into pot with beans (reserve remaining liquid). Increase heat to medium-high.",
        "Using spider or a slotted spoon, transfer pasta to pot with beans and add kale. Toss vigorously with tongs to move the pasta around to incorporate the kale as it wilts.",
        "Continue to cook, tossing often, until kale is wilted, pasta is al dente, and water is reduced by about half, about 4 minutes. If water is reduced before pasta is al dente, add another \u00bc\u2013\u00bd cup pasta cooking liquid. Reduce heat to low.",
        "Add another \u00bc cup pasta cooking liquid, then gradually add cheese, tossing all the while, until cheese is emulsified into the water and forms a luxurious, glossy sauce.",
        "Remove pot from heat and add reserved beans and sausage, then 2 Tbsp. butter, tossing, until butter is melted.",
        "Taste pasta and add more salt if needed. Cut 1 lemon in half and squeeze one half over pasta, then drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil.",
        "Divide pasta among bowls and top with reserved \u00bd cup cheese."

Cover them with hot tap water and let sit to take the chill off (cold eggs will crack when you drop them in boiling water). Cut 1 lemon in half. Grate 1 oz. Parmesan on the medium holes of a box grater. If your box grater has the side that makes thin, flat shavings, use that side. Transfer cheese to a small bowl and cover with a wet paper towel to prevent drying out.",

Test them for doneness after 15 minutes by using a skewer or fork to pierce one of the larger potatoes. The skewer should slide into the center easily with little resistance.",

        "When the timer goes off, immediately lift eggs out of water with spider or slotted spoon and plunge into ice water. Let cool a few minutes, then remove eggs from water and peel.",
        "If you\u2019re not using any appliances and want to make the pesto by hand, skip to step 11. Mix toasted walnuts and \u00be cup basil leaves in a food processor, chopper, or blender. Pulse 4\u20135 times until walnuts are chopped. Use a microplane to grate in 1 garlic clove, then zest of a lemon half.",

Place on baking sheet, tucking them in and around chickpeas and tomatoes and spacing evenly apart.",
        "Bake meatballs on top rack until about halfway cooked through, 12\u201315 minutes. Remove from oven and take a look. The tomatoes should be starting to soften and burst, and the meatballs should look opaque and feel a bit springy to the touch. If not, bake a few minutes longer.",

Make sure to scrape around sides of skillet to incorporate any remaining sauce. If you\u2019re using a thicker tortilla chip, there should be just enough sauce to coat all the chips in a thin layer. If you\u2019re using thinner chips, there\u2019s a chance the mixture will be a little dry, so we recommend adding in batches and holding back some chips if there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough sauce.",

On baking sheet with eggplant, slide a flexible metal spatula underneath ALL slices and turn them over. Slide rounds over to one side, then transfer zucchini from sheet with tomatoes onto sheet with eggplant, turning them over in the process. You should end up with tomatoes and garlic on one baking sheet, and eggplant and zucchini on the other.",
        "Let baking sheet with tomatoes cool, but return baking sheet with eggplant and zucchini to lower rack and roast until second side of eggplant is deeply browned, 10\u201315 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle.",
        "Meanwhile, combine 8 oz. ricotta, \u00be tsp. red pepper flakes, and 6 oz. mozzarella in a medium bowl. Drizzle with oil and mix with a fork to combine; season lightly with salt.",

        "Drizzle some oil into a shallow 2-qt. baking dish. Arrange one-third of zucchini and eggplant slices in a single layer. Scatter one-third of blistered tomatoes over, then dollop half of ricotta mixture over tomatoes. Tear one-third of basil leaves and scatter over ricotta.",
        "Repeat layering process with half of remaining eggplant and zucchini, all of remaining ricotta mixture, and half of remaining tomatoes and basil. Top with remaining eggplant, zucchini, and tomatoes.",
        "Sprinkle remaining 2 oz. mozzarella over and bake until mozzarella is melted and browned in spots and liquid around the edges is bubbling, 15\u201320 minutes.",
        "Let rest 10 minutes, then top with remaining basil.",
        "Drizzle with a little more oil before serving."

    "ingredients": [
        "2 large yellow onions, peeled (about 1 pound)",
        "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
        "Kosher salt",
        "Low-sodium chicken broth or water (for pan; optional)"
    ],
    "steps": [
        "Halve both onions through root end. Using the tip of your knife, cut a V-shaped notch around root to remove it (this will ensure that all slices separate when you cut the onion).",
        "Place 1 onion half on your cutting board so root end is facing you, then thinly slice onion lengthwise, starting at one side and working all the way to the other (so your knife runs through the root halfway through, not starting or ending at the root end). You\u2019re going for slices that are \u00bc\"\u2013\u215b\" thick.",
        "Repeat same slicing procedure for remaining onion halves. It\u2019s a lot of onion! But it will cook down quite a bit, so it\u2019s best to start with a large quantity.",
        "Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium until melted and sizzling. You can use a skillet to cook the onions, but a pan with high sides will keep the onions from flipping out onto your stove. Using a pan that also has a wide base gives water room to evaporate, allowing the onions to caramelize rather than steam.",
        "Instead of dumping in all of the onions at once, which would fill the pot and make it hard to stir (which would then cause the ones on the bottom to cook faster), start by adding just a couple of large handfuls to the pot. Cook, stirring, until onions are soft and starting to turn translucent, 1\u20132 minutes. Stir in a few more handfuls of onion and repeat cooking and stirring process until you\u2019ve added all the onions. Season with a pinch of salt.",
        "Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook onions, stirring every few minutes to prevent them from sticking and coloring too much in any one place, until blonde-colored, 15\u201320 minutes. This is the point of doneness for French onion soup! If you feel like onions are getting too brown around the edges or they\u2019re sticking, reduce your heat a bit.",
        "If you\u2019re going for onions that are both softer and more caramelized (say for a patty melt or onion dip), keep cooking, stirring on the regular, until onions are unmistakably golden brown, another 15\u201320 minutes. Because most of the water has cooked off at this point, there might be some bare spots where the pot could start to burn. If this happens, stir in a splash of broth or water. The liquid will dissolve the cooked-on bits, which the onions will re-absorb.",
        "For extra-dark onions, the kind that make a great burger topping, cook until they start to almost blacken around the edges and go slightly crisp, another 10\u201315 minutes. This requires constant attention so they don\u2019t burn. No one said caramelized onions were quick!",
        "Let onions cool in the saucepan, then use or transfer to an airtight container and chill. They will keep up to 1 week."
